- Meetings should be recorded
    - yet this is against policy
    - the default process is to discard knowledge!

- Classifier rule
    - paper tester only works for library-only proposals
    - what are the categories of paper?
    - how do we identify them?

- Process knowledge capture
    - Interviews can capture knowledge of the process not just C++
