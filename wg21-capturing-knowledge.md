# Capturing Living Knowledge in WG21

## Abstract

WG21's founding generation holds irreplaceable knowledge about C++ standardization—not just *what* decisions were made, but *how* to make good decisions. This knowledge exists in the minds of experts who built the committee's culture over thirty years. It has not been effectively transmitted to newer participants because WG21's documentation transmits *conclusions* rather than *judgment*.

This paper proposes a solution: an agentic workflow to capture living knowledge through structured interviews with WG21 experts. The window of opportunity is finite, and none of us are getting younger. But the knowledge is alive, the experts are willing, and the technology to capture and synthesize their insights now exists. We can preserve this institutional wisdom for future generations.

**Call to action**: Join the paper authors by volunteering to be interviewed.

## 1. The Knowledge Transmission Challenge

C++ is infrastructure. It runs your phone, your car, your bank, your hospital. The language that powers civilization's critical systems deserves a standards committee that can maintain it for generations. Preserving the committee's accumulated wisdom is essential to that mission.

### 1.1 What We Mean by "Living Knowledge"

Samo Burja's *Great Founder Theory* provides a useful framework for understanding knowledge transmission in institutions. A **tradition of knowledge** is a body of understanding that has been consecutively worked on by multiple generations. Such traditions can exist in three states:

- **Living tradition**: Knowledge successfully transferred with comprehension
- **Dead tradition**: External forms transferred (documents, procedures), but not the underlying understanding
- **Lost tradition**: Not transferred at all

> *"A living tradition of knowledge is a tradition whose body of knowledge has been successfully transferred, i.e., passed on to people who comprehend it."*

The challenge facing WG21 is keeping its tradition of knowledge *alive*—ensuring that the deep understanding of C++ standardization passes to each new generation of participants.

### 1.2 Tacit Knowledge: What Can't Be Written Down

Much of what experts know is **tacit knowledge**—understanding that cannot easily be transmitted through written documentation. A master craftsman knows things about their trade that they've never articulated, perhaps never *could* articulate. They demonstrate judgment in novel situations that no rulebook could anticipate.

> *"Since it cannot be easily transferred via texts, tacit knowledge must be taught via direct practice and extensive interaction with a skilled practitioner. Traditional master-apprentice relationships are the gold standard for these training relationships... Otherwise, the knowledge simply isn't transferred, and with many crafts, is lost forever."*

When Howard Hinnant evaluates whether a library proposal has sufficient field experience, he's drawing on decades of tacit knowledge about what has worked and what has failed. When Bjarne Stroustrup assesses whether a language feature maintains coherence with C++'s design philosophy, he's applying judgment that cannot be reduced to a checklist.

This tacit knowledge is WG21's most valuable asset. It guides the committee toward good decisions and away from bad ones. And it lives primarily in the minds of people who have been doing this work for decades.

### 1.3 The Succession Problem

Every institution faces what Great Founder Theory calls the **succession problem**: how to transfer both authority and capability from one generation to the next.

> *"The succession problem has two components: power succession (handing off the reins of the institution, keeping it piloted) and skill succession (transferring the skill needed to pilot the institution well, keeping it a live player)."*

WG21 has handled power succession reasonably well. The Convener position has transitioned, chairs rotate, meetings happen, standards ship. But skill succession—transferring the tacit knowledge of good standardization—has been more challenging.

> *"If power succession is successful but skill succession is not, then the institution remains piloted, but not a live player. Someone is at the controls, but they don't really know how to use them."*

### 1.4 WG21 Transmits Conclusions, Not Judgment

WG21 has created substantial documentation. The question is what that documentation transmits.

**Procedural Documents** tell participants *how the committee operates*:

| Document | Knowledge Transmitted |
|----------|----------------------|
| [SD-3](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-3-study-group-organizational-information), [SD-4](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures), [SD-5](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-5-meeting-information) | Procedure, logistics |
| [SD-7](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-7-mailing-procedures-and-how-to-write-papers) | Formatting, submission |
| [How to Submit a Proposal](https://isocpp.org/std/submit-a-proposal) | Process steps |

**Policy Documents** record *what decisions the committee has made*:

| Document | Knowledge Transmitted |
|----------|----------------------|
| [SD-8](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-8-standard-library-compatibility) | What breaking changes WG21 reserves |
| [SD-9](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-9-library-evolution-policies) | Default positions on `[[nodiscard]]`, `noexcept`, etc. |
| [SD-10](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-10-language-evolution-principles) | References to principles (briefly) |

**Direction Documents** articulate *high-level philosophy*:

| Document | Knowledge Transmitted |
|----------|----------------------|
| [P2000](https://wg21.link/P2000) | Vision, priorities |
| [P0592](https://wg21.link/P0592) | Feature roadmaps |

The pattern is clear: **WG21 transmits conclusions but not judgment**.

Consider SD-9, which says things like "use `[[nodiscard]]` for functions where ignoring the return value is always a bug." This is a *conclusion*—a design decision. It doesn't teach:

- How to recognize such functions
- How to make this judgment in ambiguous cases
- The underlying principle (error handling philosophy, RAII patterns)

SD-10 comes closest to real knowledge transfer by referencing "Design and Evolution of C++" principles. But the references are brief, newcomers may not have read D&E, and there's no explanation of how to apply principles to novel cases.

P2000 articulates philosophy—valuable for understanding committee goals. But it doesn't teach *how to evaluate* whether a proposal meets those goals.

**What's missing:**

- **Judgment training**: How to *think* about API design, not just what conclusions to reach
- **Generating principles**: The deep reasoning that allows extending the tradition faithfully
- **Failure case studies**: Why certain historical features failed, and how to recognize similar patterns
- **Verification mechanisms**: How to check whether understanding is genuine

> *"Someone who understands the generating principles of a tradition will be able to verify or check their knowledge, but, more importantly, they will also be able to extend it while remaining faithful to the original body of knowledge."*

The generating principles of C++ standardization—why certain things belong and others don't—are not documented anywhere. They exist in the minds of founding-era participants.

### 1.5 Case Study: The `[[nodiscard]]` Policy Papers

[SD-9: Library Evolution Policies](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-9-library-evolution-policies) represents a well-intentioned attempt to capture policy knowledge. Yet the document dates from mid-2014 and contains only one item. The supporting papers reveal the challenge of transmitting judgment even when people consciously try.

The foundational paper [P2267R1: Library Evolution Policies](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2023/p2267r1.html) captures *process*—how policies are adopted—while [P3201R1: LEWG [[nodiscard]] policy](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3201r1.html) captures only *outcome*—what the policy says. Neither transmits the judgment needed to apply the policy to novel situations.

Two rationale papers attempt deeper knowledge transfer, with instructive differences in success:

**[P3162R0](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3162r0.html) (Neațu/Sankel)** does reasonably well at conveying philosophy. The three guiding principles—minimize complexity, focus on the 90% case, center on outcomes—are genuinely transferable mental models. A reader could apply "minimize complexity" to reject a proposal that marks every getter `[[nodiscard]]`. The "90% case" principle teaches prioritization: catch the severe/common bugs, accept that edge cases slip through. "Center on outcomes" reframes the question from "what does the standard say" to "what diagnostics do users actually see"—a useful perspective shift.

The concrete examples (`.empty()` vs `.clear()` confusion, `async` synchronous trap, allocation leaks) give pattern-matching anchors. Someone could recognize analogous situations: a `reset()` that returns the old value might warrant `[[nodiscard]]` under the "common mistake" criterion.

However, the paper doesn't fully explain *why* these three principles were chosen over others, or how to resolve conflicts between them.

**[P3122R1](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3122r1.html) (Wakely)** is weaker on tacit knowledge despite being more operationally precise. The core insight—"implementors know best, stop micromanaging"—is valuable but presented as assertion rather than derived from principles. The paper gives excellent *what* (the proposed wording categories) but limited *why* for each category. Why are comparison operators special? Why does the const/non-const distinction matter? The examples illustrate but don't teach the underlying reasoning.

The wording itself is a checklist, not a framework. A reader could apply it to existing standard library functions but would struggle with genuinely novel patterns. If someone invents a new abstraction that doesn't fit the bullets, they have no tools to reason about it.

**What's missing from both:**

Neither paper addresses the deeper question: what is `[[nodiscard]]` *for*? Is it a bug-catching mechanism, a documentation tool, an API design signal, or a way to encode programmer intent? The answer affects everything. If it's purely about catching bugs, frequency data matters. If it's about intent, consistency matters more.

Neither discusses the cost model for false positives. When does an unwanted warning become actively harmful? This omission means readers can't calibrate the tradeoff.

Neither provides negative examples—cases where `[[nodiscard]]` was added and later regretted, or where reasonable people disagreed. Learning from mistakes transfers tacit knowledge better than success stories.

**Assessment:** P3162R0 transfers approximately 60% of the tacit knowledge needed to reason independently about new cases. P3122R1 transfers approximately 30%, functioning more as a reference specification than a teaching document. Neither fully equips a reader to handle genuinely novel situations or to argue persuasively for a position the papers don't explicitly cover.

This case study illustrates why documentation alone—even good-faith rationale documentation—cannot fully capture the judgment that experienced committee members apply. The missing 40-70% is precisely what interviews could capture.

## 2. The Knowledge Exists

The good news is that the knowledge we need to capture demonstrably *exists*. Long-time committee participants possess deep understanding of WG21's principles and history. Their reflections reveal exactly the kind of tacit knowledge that should be preserved.

> **Note** The isocpp reflector is private, and quotes are provided by permission from the authors.

### 2.1 Bjarne Stroustrup on Coherence

**Source:** `lib/2016/11/1321.php` (November 9, 2016)
**Context:** Post to the library reflector about C++17 and committee direction

> *That said, I worry about the future of C++. Those of you who saw my CppCon keynote or have participated in some of the WG21 evening sessions know that I'm concerned about our lack of direction.*
>
> *My main concern is that we are delaying decisions about major issues while moving quite fast with minor proposals that do not appear to be strongly connected to the rest of the language. The effect is to complicate the language with many minor conveniences (each helping someone but most not affecting the majority of C++ developers) while repeatedly rehashing major proposals (complicating parts, rejecting other parts, and failing to see connections between proposals brought forward in separate papers). This does not lead to a simpler and more coherent language as seen by developers. In fact, many developers fear the work of the committee as adding complexity without benefits. I find it far easier to allay such fears presenting major features delivering major benefits than by listing lots of little features – however beloved by C++ language and library experts.*
>
> *Please consider the possibility of a moratorium on new minor proposals until we have decided a set of major features that we should aim to include in C++20. This would avoid the problem we had with many significant proposals "almost ready" for C++17 while our efforts diffused on minor proposals and debates about novel alternatives to the major proposals. Ideally, we would have a vote on that set of features at the next meeting (Kona), so that we would have 3 years to integrate them into the standard and try them out.*
>
> *...We should aim at a coherent set of features and be able to lay out a (not too detailed) roadmap for ourselves and for the C++ community. The community wants to know that we are making significant progress and where we are going. It is important to them.*

The founder of C++ sees when coherence is being lost—when proposals don't connect to the language's underlying design philosophy. Note that Bjarne has to *ask* for a moratorium, *suggest* focusing on major features, *propose* a roadmap. If skill succession had worked, the committee would already be doing this. The fact that the founder has to intervene to remind the committee of its purpose is diagnostic. This judgment, honed over four decades, can be captured through structured conversation.

### 2.2 Howard Hinnant on Field Experience

**Source:** `lib/2016/07/0664.php` (July 22, 2016)
**Context:** Discussion about std::variant lacking field experience before standardization

> *I think we (collectively) should either have an all-out push to publish an open-source C++17 variant implementation 2 weeks ahead of the nearest national body comment deadline, or we should all write strongly worded national body comments to remove variant from the CD for lack of field experience. This comment of mine is actually far more liberal than I am comfortable with. A more conservative viewpoint (with which I would not disagree) is to pull variant regardless, for lack of field experience.*
>
> *The last time we went down this road, the proposers managed to write an implementation of their proposal mere hours prior to the vote, and giddily announced that their proposal was implemented at the vote. That announcement swayed the committee to vote in favor. The result was just yet another example of our collective failure. An implementation needs positive field experience prior to standardization.*
>
> *I should quit asking: 'Has it been implemented?' The correct question is: What has been the field experience? Is there positive feedback from anyone outside your immediate family or people who could have a perceived conflict of interest (such as employees of your company)? Having your Mom and your direct reports say the proposal is wonderful is nice, but not sufficient.*
>
> *Doing otherwise is an affront to proposals such as Filesystem which has gone through years of scrutiny of an actual (widely-used) implementation.*

Howard is articulating a **generating principle**—the deep reasoning that should guide standardization decisions. He's not just saying "we need implementations"; he's explaining *why* and *what kind* of validation matters.

**Source:** `lib/2016/07/0694.php` (July 25, 2016)
**Context:** Continued discussion about variant

> *It is now my understanding that we (the committee) have made significant design changes with respect to all existing variants in the field (most notably boost::variant). We /think/ these are good changes, and I /hope/ that we are right. We won't /know/ if these are good design changes until we have field experience with an implementation that implements these design changes.*
>
> *Currently we are on track to standardize something where the only field experience is with something with significant design changes relative to our spec. I won't bother to go down the list of libraries where this strategy has failed us in the past. It is hard enough to get something right /with/ a little field experience.*
>
> *The reason we have the TS system is to handle exactly this situation.*
>
> *Now I can only blame myself. I did not get myself to Oulu (this time it was a wedding instead of a funeral — a much better reason!). And if I had, I wasn't really following variant so closely as to know that there wasn't at least one implementation tracking at least the major design changes over the years. Perhaps I could have asked that question in full committee prior to the vote (if I had been there). Perhaps the answer would not have swayed any vote but my own.*

"I won't bother to go down the list of libraries where this strategy has failed us in the past." This is **tacit knowledge**—Howard knows which library standardizations failed and why, but he doesn't enumerate them. The knowledge lives in his head. When he retires or reduces participation, that list goes with him.

Also note Howard's self-blame: "I can only blame myself. I did not get myself to Oulu." The system depends on specific experts being physically present to ask the right questions. When they're absent, the questions don't get asked. This is not a robust institution.

### 2.3 Nico Josuttis on Integration Time

**Source:** `lib/2016/05/0304.php` (May 17, 2016)
**Context:** Discussion about string_view integration in C++17

> *It seems what I feared has happened: The train model has failed, giving not enough time for integration. (No serious software project would add features with wide impact without giving time for integration and maturity. We gave less than a week for integration.)*
>
> *If we continue, c++17 will de-facto become a beta release for the next major release (if we don't make the same mistakes again...)*
>
> *Maybe it's time to feature freeze c++18 NOW with some additional language support such as concepts.*
>
> *Just my thoughts, but I really don't know now which story to tell about C++17...*

Nico observes that process is outpacing judgment. The train model (fixed release schedule) creates pressure to ship features before they're integrated—before experts can evaluate how they interact with the rest of the standard. "I really don't know now which story to tell about C++17"—the expert has lost the narrative. He can't explain what the committee is doing in terms that make sense.

**Source:** `lib/2016/05/0311.php` (May 18, 2016)
**Context:** Discussion about whether to standardize string_view given unresolved design questions

> *I fear we have to decide now between one of three options regarding string_view. And in essence, the key question is WHICH MAJOR PURPOSE DOES string_view HAVE?*
>
> *EITHER:*
>
> *1 Decide that the major purpose of string_view is to represent non-null-terminated strings...*
>
> *OR:*
>
> *2 Decide that the major purpose of string_view is to become THE standard type for interfaces who want to process string-like objects...*
>
> *OR:*
>
> *3 If we can't decide, skip standardizing string_view at all.*
> *- Yes, we rarely do that, but*
> *  auto_ptr and async() should be lessons learned... ;-)*

Nico explicitly names **specific past failures**—`auto_ptr` and `async()`—as cautionary examples. This is the oral tradition in action: an expert invoking historical precedent to guide current decisions.

But notice the ";-)"—he's half-joking, suggesting that invoking these lessons is unusual, perhaps even quaint. The committee "rarely" decides not to standardize something. The process has momentum; the default is to ship. There's no formal mechanism for error correction. The knowledge of *why* those features failed isn't documented anywhere.

### 2.4 Alisdair Meredith on Cultural Knowledge

**Source:** `lib/2016/09/1034.php` (September 9, 2016)
**Context:** Asked why `bad_optional_access` inherits from `logic_error` but `bad_variant_access` doesn't

> *Lack of cultural knowledge.*
>
> *For C++98 there was a conscious effort to design a coherent exception hierarchy, with a distinction between runtime and logic errors in the library, and more primitive exceptions deriving directly from std::exception carrying the minimal payload - just a vtable pointer, with 'what' returning a string literal in each case.*
>
> *For C++11, we added a few new library exceptions for types added in TR1, and they followed the idiom of deriving directly from std::exception, rather than the more appropriate-looking std::runtime_error. I queried this at the time, I think I filed an NB comment, but the conclusion was that runtime/logic_error were failed experiments, and we should stop doing that. The exception to the rule being when you really did have more information to return in the exception object, when the new system_error type would be appropriate.*
>
> *For the Library Fundamentals TS, there does not appear to have been a consistent policy applied, and I am not sure if LEWG are aware of the history, or have an intentional exception model in mind when they review libraries.*
>
> *It would certainly be worth filing an NB comment on the topic again, to achieve some clarity on how the group feels...*

This is precisely the kind of knowledge that needs to be captured. An LWG expert explicitly states that LEWG "may not be aware of the history"—the design decisions that should inform their reviews exist only in the minds of founding-era participants. The exception hierarchy decision was made, recorded nowhere, and now LEWG makes new decisions without knowing the precedent. Alisdair holds this knowledge—and can share it.

### 2.5 The Pattern

These quotes demonstrate that **the knowledge is alive in experts' minds**:

| Expert | Knowledge Held |
|--------|----------------|
| Bjarne Stroustrup | Design coherence judgment, connection between proposals and philosophy |
| Howard Hinnant | List of library standardization failures, field experience principle |
| Nico Josuttis | Integration requirements, specific failure case studies |
| Alisdair Meredith | Exception hierarchy history, design decisions not documented |

> *"Students of a tradition can appear to possess understanding of a tradition's body of knowledge despite actually lacking it. This is counterfeit understanding."*

The risk is not that WG21's knowledge is lost—it's that it remains locked in the minds of a few experts while newer participants develop counterfeit understanding: knowing the procedures without grasping the principles.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution: Agentic Knowledge Capture

The knowledge exists. The experts are available. What's needed is a systematic method to extract, preserve, and transmit their tacit understanding.

### 3.1 The Interview-Based Approach

We propose an **agentic workflow** to capture living knowledge through structured interviews with WG21 experts:

1. **Structured interviews**: Conduct recorded conversations with experienced committee members, guided by questions designed to elicit tacit knowledge
2. **AI-assisted transcription**: Use modern speech-to-text to create accurate transcripts
3. **Knowledge synthesis**: Apply AI tools to identify patterns, extract principles, and organize insights
4. **Expert review**: Have interviewees review synthesized content for accuracy
5. **Publication**: Make captured knowledge available to the committee and broader C++ community

### 3.2 Why Interviews Work

Written documentation struggles to capture tacit knowledge because experts often can't articulate what they know until prompted by specific situations. Interviews solve this by:

- **Providing concrete scenarios**: "When you saw proposal X, what made you concerned?"
- **Allowing follow-up**: "Can you give another example of that pattern?"
- **Capturing stories**: Narratives about specific decisions and their outcomes
- **Revealing judgment**: How experts approach novel situations

> *"Errors in transmission from one generation to the next are almost guaranteed and thus require proactive measures to correct them and maintain the fidelity of a tradition."*

Interviews are a proactive measure to capture knowledge before transmission errors compound.

### 3.3 Interview Guide

Effective interviews elicit tacit knowledge that experts may not realize they possess. The key is drawing out *stories*—specific narratives about decisions, problems, and outcomes. Learning from mistakes transfers tacit knowledge better than success stories, though both have value.

**Interview Technique**

Start with a general question, then use the response to drill down into a relatable story:

1. **Open broadly**: "What do you look for when evaluating a library proposal?"
2. **Identify a thread**: Listen for hints of specific experiences
3. **Request the story**: "Can you tell me about a time when that principle mattered?"
4. **Explore the details**: What happened? What did you learn? What would you do differently?

**Example Questions**

*For failure stories (highest value for knowledge transfer):*

- "Tell me about a time you had a very difficult decision on a proposal. What made it hard? How did it turn out?"
- "What's a feature that got standardized that you wish hadn't? What went wrong in the process?"
- "Tell me about a proposal that looked good on paper but failed in practice. What did we miss?"

*For success stories:*

- "What's a proposal that went through the process well? What made it work?"
- "Tell me about a time the committee correctly rejected something. How did people know?"

**Topic Areas to Explore**

*Generating Principles*

- What coordination failures justify standardization?
- When is an external library sufficient?
- How do we evaluate vocabulary necessity vs. utility convenience?
- What perpetual costs does standardization impose?

*Design Philosophy*

- What is the relationship between performance and interface standardization?
- When do we prioritize theoretical consistency vs. practical utility?
- How do we balance backwards compatibility against fixing mistakes?

*Evaluation Frameworks*

- What questions should every paper answer?
- What evidence demonstrates genuine demand?
- How do we distinguish proposer-driven from user-driven proposals?

*Case Studies*

- Which standardized features proved problematic, and why?
- Which rejected proposals were correctly rejected?
- What patterns indicate a proposal needs more work?

### 3.4 How AI Enables This Now

Modern AI capabilities make this project feasible in ways that weren't possible even a few years ago:

- **High-quality transcription**: Accurate speech-to-text for technical conversations
- **Synthesis across interviews**: Identifying common themes and principles from multiple sources
- **Structured extraction**: Converting narrative knowledge into organized frameworks
- **Accessibility**: Making captured knowledge searchable and navigable

We have developed an agentic knowledge extraction framework ([WG21_CAPTURE_RULE.md](https://github.com/cppalliance/wg21-capturing-knowledge/WG21_CAPTURE_RULE.md)) that processes interview transcripts and produces structured output distinguishing:

- **Principles**: Distilled, actionable rules that can be applied to evaluate new proposals
- **Experiences**: Supporting stories that illustrate and validate the principles

The output is dual-purpose: human-readable markdown for expert review and verification, with embedded metadata enabling downstream agentic processing. Each principle includes "When to Apply" conditions and "Red Flags" for violations; each experience links back to the principles it supports.

The technology to preserve WG21's institutional wisdom exists today.

## 4. Experimental Evidence

To demonstrate what captured knowledge looks like, we interviewed several prominent members of the standardization committee, who possess deep knowledge of the language and extensive experience. Our methodology consisted of audio-only interviews with AI-assisted captured transcriptions. These transcriptions were processed using an agentic workflow to create a synthesis of distilled knowledge. We present the distilled knowledge below, and links to the original transcripts and the agentic workflow.

### 4.1 Matheus Izvekov

## 5. Conclusion: The Window Is Open

The knowledge we need to capture is alive in the minds of WG21's most experienced participants. Bjarne Stroustrup is 75. Herb Sutter is 60. The founding generation's members are not getting younger. None of us are.

But this is not an obituary—it's an opportunity. The experts are here, they're willing to share what they know, and we now have the tools to capture and preserve their insights. The window is open, but it won't stay open forever.

> *"Over time, functional institutions decay. As the landscape of founders and institutions changes, so does the landscape of society."*

Decay is not inevitable if we act. C++ has earned a standards committee that can maintain its health for generations. The founding generation built something remarkable. Preserving their wisdom is how we honor that achievement—and how we ensure WG21 remains a living tradition of knowledge rather than a dead one.

**What you can do:**

If you are an experienced WG21 participant willing to share your knowledge through an interview, please contact the paper authors. Your insights—about design principles, historical decisions, evaluation frameworks, failure cases—are exactly what we need to capture.

If you are a newer participant who would benefit from access to captured knowledge, your interest demonstrates the demand for this project.

The knowledge exists. The technology exists. The will exists. Let's capture living knowledge while we still can.

### 5.1 Beyond WG21

This process is not specific to WG21. The agentic interview workflow described here can be applied to any organization facing knowledge transmission challenges.

The job of the interviewer is not particularly difficult given a reasonable general script. People enjoy talking about themselves and their experiences—especially when asked thoughtful questions about work they're proud of or lessons they've learned the hard way. The interviewer's role is primarily to listen, follow interesting threads, and ask for stories.

A company like Bloomberg could deploy this workflow across the organization to capture and preserve institutional knowledge from senior engineers, traders, and domain experts before they retire or move on. The same applies to any institution where tacit knowledge accumulates in the minds of experienced practitioners: law firms, hospitals, research labs, government agencies.

The combination of structured interviews, AI-assisted transcription, and knowledge synthesis creates a scalable approach to a problem that has plagued organizations for as long as organizations have existed: how do you keep hard-won wisdom from walking out the door?
