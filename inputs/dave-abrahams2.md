## Transcript Start

[00:00:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Here, I think. 

[00:00:02] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Okay. 

[00:00:02] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I think the kitchen is where people, 

[00:00:05] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** people mill around. Hang around. Yeah. And then we can, uh, 

[00:00:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, 

[00:00:08] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** we can find out what people wanna drink. 

[00:00:09] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Of course, of course. Uh, if the food is here when they get here, then who knows what they'll want to do. 

[00:00:16] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Right. I don't know, dear. I'm just gonna have a piece of cheese in a dainty way Of course.

[00:00:24] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** As though I wouldn't just shove it all down my mandible. 

[00:00:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Hey, you, no pictures.[00:00:30] 

[00:00:31] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Uh, we're getting ready for Doug and Amy Gregor to come over. Yeah. They haven't been over since our renovations, so that'll be 

[00:00:37] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** some of our oldest friends and who we haven't seen in almost, almost forever. 

Yeah. 

[00:00:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So yeah, I said, I apparently said something wrong and, and. Uh, 

[00:00:48] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** but that before that you worked together, so you saw each other all the time.

[00:00:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, 

[00:00:53] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** and I never saw Amy. We so Well, 

[00:00:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** there's that too. 

[00:00:56] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** So there, some of it was just like proximity and so it's only been a couple years [00:01:00] since 

[00:01:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** there's that too. Yeah, 

[00:01:00] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** since, uh, since we haven't, we haven't overlapped, but in general we didn't, uh, we both had little kids and, uh, spent a lot of time doing kid wrangling and so that phase of life when you only socialize with the parents of the, your kids' friends is what we've all been in.

[00:01:24] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** So that was a big factor as well. 

[00:01:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Doug was, I considered him a really close friend for a [00:01:30] long time, and, and it was heartbreaking for me that, that we, you know, couldn't get along. It's all of a sudden. And so, um, so this could be important. I mean, I, I. You know, I assume he is not coming here without, without being prepared to forgive me for what I did.

[00:01:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, but, um, yeah, uh, yeah, and, and he was, Doug was an important part of my life in [00:02:00] all the work that I did around Boost and C++ and generic programming. Um, you know, so we were, and, and on Swift too. I mean, 

[00:02:12] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** coming to Apple at all. 

[00:02:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Coming to Apple at all. We were, you know, I, I consider Swift to be, you know, one of my greatest contributions.

[00:02:23] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I, and I, you know, it never would've happened without Doug. And, [00:02:30] and, uh, you know, he, he played an even more significant role in that than I did. Um, so.

[00:02:47] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Hey, welcome. 

[00:02:48] **AMY GREGOR:** Hello. So 

[00:02:48] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** great to see you.

[00:02:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** see yeah,

[00:02:52] **AMY GREGOR:** like a hop, skip, and a jump away. I know. How's it going? I'll take off my shoes. Thank

[00:03:08] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** been a long time. 

[00:03:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh yeah. Yeah. I've missed you guys. 

[00:03:12] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, welcome. Thank you. You haven't been here since we renovated? No. 

[00:03:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Hey, can I get one of those? Yeah. 

[00:03:18] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Should I lock your 

[00:03:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** one of those? Yes you can. 

[00:03:22] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And I'm trying like 

[00:03:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** a long time look 

[00:03:25] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** attractive 

[00:03:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** on. I was afraid it might never happen.

[00:03:28] **DOUG GREGOR:** One way to do it. [00:03:30] You went through a lot of work to, uh, get us back together here. Uh, the whole documentary. 

[00:03:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh yeah. I mean, they. They, uh, you know, arranged it themselves, so 

[00:03:41] **DOUG GREGOR:** that's cool. 

[00:03:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. I didn't, I didn't do this. Oh, you're just joking. 

[00:03:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** I'm joking. 

[00:03:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. You know, you remember me. I was born without a sense of humor.

[00:03:48] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's so 

[00:03:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** sad. Yeah, it's, 

[00:03:51] **DOUG GREGOR:** I did find an old picture. 

[00:03:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh yeah, 

[00:03:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** I did. I was digging around. I was like, okay, can I find something from the olden days old? I found me. Which is sad. Which is [00:04:00] funny, but like with Jeremy. 

[00:04:02] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, wow. 

[00:04:03] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think this was Redmond 2004. 

[00:04:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, 

[00:04:08] **DOUG GREGOR:** we were a little bit younger. 

[00:04:10] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Yeah, we were, 

[00:04:11] **DOUG GREGOR:** and my kids say I was really short, 

[00:04:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** but 

[00:04:14] **DOUG GREGOR:** I, no, Dave is really tall 

[00:04:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** and, and you're standing downhill, I think.

[00:04:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I mean, Ron is, 

maybe 

[00:04:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** Ron's taller than me though. 

[00:04:21] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Is he? Yeah. 

[00:04:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. He is. 

[00:04:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Jeremy's taller than you in this picture, and I don't think he's taller than you. 

[00:04:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. I don't think he is either. 

[00:04:28] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. [00:04:30] Anyway, 

[00:04:30] **DOUG GREGOR:** but I like your explanation that I'm standing down the hill. 

[00:04:32] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:04:33] **DOUG GREGOR:** I'm gonna go with that. 

[00:04:33] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Go with that one.

[00:04:34] **DOUG GREGOR:** I'm gonna tell 

[00:04:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. I've got, I've got souls on here. 

[00:04:40] **DOUG GREGOR:** Oh, there you, 

[00:04:40] **AMY GREGOR:** let's take care of that. 

[00:04:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yep. Yeah. That's the, that's the one that, uh, was posted on the Boost site. 

[00:04:47] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes. 

[00:04:48] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. For the longest time. 

[00:04:49] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah, yeah, 

[00:04:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, yeah. 

[00:04:50] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. Until it went offline. But the way back, 

[00:04:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** so this is, this is what Doug looked like when I met him.

[00:04:55] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:04:55] **DOUG GREGOR:** Like this. 

[00:04:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, except he, he was wearing that shirt that he always [00:05:00] wore. You were, you were still wearing that when I got to Apple. There's this stripe with the stripe across the middle. Oh, the 

[00:05:05] **DOUG GREGOR:** stripe. That thing finally got so thread bare that 

[00:05:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, did it? 

[00:05:07] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think Amy got rid of it. Oh, 

[00:05:09] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** okay. 

[00:05:10] **DOUG GREGOR:** And I couldn't replace it, but yes.

[00:05:12] **DOUG GREGOR:** The one stripe. 

[00:05:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:05:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** Cool. Anyway, thought that'd be fun. 

[00:05:18] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, are these copies, can I keep these? 

[00:05:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** Oh yeah, sure. 

[00:05:21] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, so cool. 

[00:05:24] **DOUG GREGOR:** And I was like thinking, wow, I was really young back then. Yeah, 

[00:05:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** it happens. 

[00:05:29] **DOUG GREGOR:** [00:05:30] And so I'm like, let's go find a picture. Oh, my Boost fixture. Yeah. That's, that's the right time. 

[00:05:34] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Yeah. I 

[00:05:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** think that was a little bit before I found Boost, but 

[00:05:38] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** was it?

[00:05:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Oh, no. I don't care. Okay. Um, you want to go look at the Giant?

[00:05:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I have no clue. No, no, 

[00:05:50] **AMY GREGOR:** no, I'm not. 

[00:05:51] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It's just, 

[00:05:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** um, uh, 

[00:05:55] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** what's up? 

[00:05:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Is there anything that can be done here? 

[00:05:58] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** You, or could you [00:06:00] could, uh, talk about drinks? 

[00:06:01] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Okay. Let's talk about drinks. What do you want to drink? Have, have you been to see him? Doug? 

[00:06:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** I have not seen him in years. 

[00:06:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, he, he, he would love a visit. He loves visitors and, and if.

[00:06:15] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** If, do you want, you know, I should go up and see him again soon. If you're, if you're feeling nervous about, about going by yourself or whatever 

[00:06:23] **AMY GREGOR:** in there, 

[00:06:23] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I'll take you with me. I think that would, that could be a really good conversation. Well, it's just, 

[00:06:28] **DOUG GREGOR:** yeah. Great to see him. [00:06:30] Oops. Don't know how well he knows me because I have not seen him.

[00:06:34] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, come, no, Doug 

[00:06:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** debating concepts. 

[00:06:38] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, he, where is he at now? He remember, uh, lives in Pa Palo Alto. Yeah. My gosh. Oh, no. See, see, this is me not knowing anything about wine. Um, yeah, so he's, um, he's not in great health and, um, how does this work? See, I don't know anything. [00:07:00] Uh, gonna have to get the, the kind.

[00:07:04] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Do we have the kind with the little, the things that go around the outside? Did, 

[00:07:07] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** did you break it? 

[00:07:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. It sort of strip the threads as, as it work. So he might've started out a little trepidatious because of that. Um, but, but yeah. Um, yeah. Amazing guy to talk to. 

[00:07:26] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:07:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** He just, he knows about everything. 

[00:07:28] **DOUG GREGOR:** He knows about everything [00:07:30] and he's interested in everything.

[00:07:31] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:07:33] **DOUG GREGOR:** Oh, go off 

[00:07:34] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** and 

[00:07:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** read some extra literature and obsessed with it. 

[00:07:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And he's got very clear opinions about what things are, are great in, in the world. What, what cultural artifacts are great. And 

[00:07:47] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** what's 

[00:07:47] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** this? What's worth, what's worth paying attention to 

[00:07:50] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** dressing? Hmm. 

[00:07:53] **AMY GREGOR:** I think Jeremy or Katie, like, we haven't seen them in years.

[00:07:57] **AMY GREGOR:** I haven't, 

[00:07:58] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah. It's been 

[00:07:59] **AMY GREGOR:** on [00:08:00] Instagram or whatever, one of those social media sets. 

[00:08:02] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It's been a while. I did some work with, with, uh, Jeremy on. On the carbon project. Mm-hmm. Um, 

[00:08:10] **AMY GREGOR:** oh yeah. 

[00:08:11] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, which, yeah. Um, right. That's, it's, yes, it's a, yes. There is a joke there and I already told it. Um, but, um, but, uh, that's good.

[00:08:27] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. So, [00:08:30] so he, he is, has definitely left the generic programming world behind 

[00:08:40] **AMY GREGOR:** Jeremy. 

[00:08:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:08:42] **DOUG GREGOR:** He's into, uh, 

[00:08:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** he's into pure functional programming, 

[00:08:46] **DOUG GREGOR:** peer functional programming. Well, he, uh, gradual typing was 

[00:08:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** the 

[00:08:49] **DOUG GREGOR:** thing he was into for 

[00:08:50] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** sure. 

[00:08:50] **DOUG GREGOR:** A very long time. 

[00:08:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. He got 

[00:08:52] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** that open. Now I need to pour it. 

[00:08:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** He didn't.

[00:08:54] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, okay. Um,

[00:08:59] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I [00:09:00] think it was. And, and I, I didn't realize this, but like I discovered a talk of his, uh, online where he is explaining how to read, uh, sort of computerized theory notation. And it's a, it is a, it's a really nice talk, but it explains, he was a lot younger when he gave that talk and he explains how he, how he basically found functional programming and never looked back.

[00:09:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** That's interesting. [00:09:30] And, and you know, basically it's, he was trying to get something to work in C++ and, and it was just impossible. And it was, and it had bugs in it and it crashed and, and, you know, and all of that. And, and so, you know, I think he, he learned the wrong lesson as, as people do the standing, the standing agreement.

[00:09:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** When you went to visit Alex for, for many years. [00:10:00] Has been don't talk about programming. 

[00:10:02] **DOUG GREGOR:** Hmm. Interesting. 

[00:10:02] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Because when he retired, he wanted 

[00:10:05] **DOUG GREGOR:** to just wanna be done, 

[00:10:06] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** get out of it. 

[00:10:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** Okay. 

[00:10:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, uh, me, uh, and, and, and then 

[00:10:12] **DOUG GREGOR:** you would 

[00:10:12] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** go for, sorry. You would go for a walk with him. Like, normally what would happen is he would 

[00:10:19] **DOUG GREGOR:** say, 

[00:10:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** let's take Stella, my Corgi for a walk.

[00:10:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah, 

[00:10:22] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah. And, and, um, 

[00:10:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** we'd 

[00:10:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** go 

[00:10:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** for a walk and at some point he would start talking about, [00:10:30] about programming and, and his, his legacy 

[00:10:37] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** basically. 

[00:10:38] **DOUG GREGOR:** And, and, uh, yeah. And his, it made me sad 

[00:10:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** because he's, he's influenced so many of us that have made an impact on the industry that he, 

[00:10:51] **DOUG GREGOR:** he 

[00:10:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** feels like his experiment was a failure.

[00:10:54] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** You know, like his vision was 

[00:10:56] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:10:57] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Large catalogs of, of [00:11:00] reusable, well-documented generic components, you know? 

[00:11:03] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:11:05] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, uh, you know, for, for reasons we understand, you know, I couldn't even begin to approach that with the Swift Standard Library. 

[00:11:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right, 

[00:11:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** because it was, it was too big. No, no, it 

[00:11:18] **DOUG GREGOR:** was, no, it was 'cause we couldn't ship that '

[00:11:21] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** cause of the size.

[00:11:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Sure. It was getting put in binaries, right? Sure, sure. Um, uh, but, but yeah, [00:11:30] so, so, and 

[00:11:31] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** then the last time, the last time I saw him was just a few weeks ago, Sean and my, my group at Adobe went up to visit him. Do you know David Sankel? 

[00:11:42] **DOUG GREGOR:** Is, I have never met David Sankel . 

[00:11:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Okay. Well, so David Sankel, he says he came to Adobe because he wanted to work with me, so that's great.

[00:11:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** He was hired into our group and, and Nick DeMarco is a, um, more junior, a very excellent, uh, very [00:12:00] excellent guy that had been on Photoshop with Sean. And, um, so the four of us went up to visit Alex 

[00:12:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:12:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And sat around his table and talked to him. And at the end, David Sankel asked Alex if he would ever consider giving a talk again.

[00:12:15] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And Ah, okay. And actually there's an opening. Wow. Yeah. And I found that really surprising because Alex was, had been pretty adamant about kind of being out of it. [00:12:30] Um, yeah. 

[00:12:31] **DOUG GREGOR:** Huh. 

[00:12:31] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So, 

[00:12:32] **DOUG GREGOR:** um, maybe he's feeling better about it than who knows? 

[00:12:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I, yeah. I, I think, uh. Yeah, I don't, I don't actually know. Um, uh,

[00:12:48] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I, he, 

[00:12:50] **DOUG GREGOR:** he, he never, he never completely let it go. I guess. Like he makes, he, he thinks, you know, when you retire, you have to retire. That's the [00:13:00] advice he gives. He gives me, you know, you have to like, get out 

[00:13:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** and, and, but he's been out for a long time and, um, yeah, he has, he has so much to contribute. Um, yeah. 

[00:13:14] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Um, shall we move to the table 

[00:13:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** for sure.

[00:13:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So 

[00:13:17] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** reunions? 

[00:13:18] **AMY GREGOR:** Yes. It's so fun. Yeah. Lots of ventures. Thank you. There you go.

[00:13:27] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. He's at, um, Lewis and Clark. [00:13:30] 

[00:13:30] **AMY GREGOR:** Wow. 

[00:13:30] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** First semester of freshman year. 

[00:13:32] **DOUG GREGOR:** And 

[00:13:33] **AMY GREGOR:** does that work? No, Oregon. Yeah, Oregon. Portland. Yeah. It was amazing. Yeah. 

And 

[00:13:36] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** my 

[00:13:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** brother's up there, so Oh, that's nice. Because he's very much a homebody and we thought he was probably gonna wanna, you know, live at home and, I mean, which would've been fine, whatever he wanted to do.

[00:13:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. But I was hoping he spread his wings a bit and yeah, 

[00:13:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** a little 

[00:13:49] **DOUG GREGOR:** peace. Loving 

[00:13:50] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** it up there. It 

[00:13:50] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** was the rain. He's already worn out his umbrella. 

[00:13:53] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** So fun. Just in the first semester. 

[00:13:56] **DOUG GREGOR:** Well 

[00:13:57] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** there has some, like, there's some giant, I mean, Portland's [00:14:00] getting up the edge of it, but Hall of Washington State is like flooded out right now.

[00:14:03] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** There's a massive 

[00:14:05] **AMY GREGOR:** That's interesting. Storm. It's nice to disease. Found a place though. 

[00:14:08] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, should we just pass 

[00:14:11] **DOUG GREGOR:** over? Are Tessa and Molly doing? Oh, they're doing well. Tessa 13. 

[00:14:16] **AMY GREGOR:** I 

[00:14:16] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** was gonna say she must be 'cause she was at the same age as my little niece. When you guys were here for Dave's 50th. Molly?

[00:14:23] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yes. I just remember she and, and Vivi. Um. Clicked with each 

[00:14:28] **AMY GREGOR:** other. That's so sweet. I'm [00:14:30] glad you remember. That's 

[00:14:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** something more than I thought I was taking. 

[00:14:32] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah, she, um, yeah. And Molly's 11 and t is 13. 

[00:14:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, I didn't plate up the 

[00:14:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** fish. There's salmon. Um, I, 

[00:14:39] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** I, I didn't do it for obvious reasons, but I thought maybe there's enough food that we don't need it.

[00:14:43] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Also, it's, except 

[00:14:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** to, um, would anybody like some salmon 

[00:14:46] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** since it's your 

[00:14:48] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes, please. Okay. 

[00:14:49] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Alright. There you go. 

[00:14:50] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Why not? 

[00:14:51] **AMY GREGOR:** I'm good. 

[00:14:52] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And you might want some lactate, Davy, because I'm these the potatoes no doubt have 

[00:14:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And 

[00:14:57] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** the buns and there's cheese in the, in the bread. Yeah, sure. [00:15:00] 

[00:15:02] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah. Into theater and while he's in ballet and so Oh, cool.

[00:15:06] **AMY GREGOR:** Band and band 

[00:15:08] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** VI is, this is a very intimate motion. She was doing. Um, good. Uh, I see getting, oh, sweet. Then decided that it was really dance for her and she's like super into it. That's great. That's 

[00:15:19] **AMY GREGOR:** sweet. 

[00:15:20] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Trying 

[00:15:20] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** to keep myself from, I just see from, you know, little bit what they're up to, but 

[00:15:25] **AMY GREGOR:** yeah, I wish that they would spend more time programming, [00:15:30] honestly, because Molly, Molly shows promise, but she does, it's different with, I don't know, it's an inter, we talk about this a lot, how Molly wants to do, like, she talks about how I make Daddy something, you know, like with Scratch program.

[00:15:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** Oh, cool. 

[00:15:44] **AMY GREGOR:** Things like that. And she has the mind for it. But you haven't really pushed it. She 

[00:15:48] **DOUG GREGOR:** does, but I have not pushed on it yet. 

[00:15:50] **AMY GREGOR:** I know 

[00:15:51] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Moses definitely went through a phase of, yeah, like he would make animated cards, you know, in program math, but then he got interested in his own [00:16:00] thing and it's. Like, you know, it was for him.

[00:16:03] **AMY GREGOR:** Does he do anything 

[00:16:04] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** into the, he like we were somewhat surprised to discover that he wanted to be a computer science major. Like wasn't until I started the college search. It was like, oh you do. Okay. I mean we knew that he was interested in you coding, but um, 

[00:16:16] **AMY GREGOR:** I 

[00:16:17] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** keep it over there. Um, alright. I forgot the vegetables.

[00:16:22] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, that Doug deal with the problem. The problem. Where to put the fish down. I'll figure it out. 

[00:16:28] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It's a good problem. 

[00:16:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** This is merely 

an 

[00:16:29] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** [00:16:30] optimization 

[00:16:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** problem. There 

[00:16:31] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** it is. Little bad thing. That's stagey. 

[00:16:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I see. It's not naming our cash coherency. Exactly. Cash eviction. I forget 

[00:16:41] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** what. So yeah. Uh, so, uh, Japanese was the other thing Wow.

[00:16:44] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** That he wanted to study. And Lewis Clark has excellent programs for both. So you Right.

[00:16:59] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** There a time [00:17:00] when I didn't know about Boo. Well, yes, of course. Um, it all sort of came around the same time that we met in person. 'cause we met at, um, the Sikhs wedding. That was like, I knew, you know, I knew your name Doug. And then we like got to hang out in person there. That was the first time, um, that we, that we, uh, like hung out.

[00:17:25] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** For real. Yeah. But, um, I mean, knowing, for me, knowing [00:17:30] Dave and knowing how much he cared about things like exception, safety and, and like rigor in programming that everybody shouldn't just freestyle from scratch whenever they want to do something. Um, boost, boost just made, it just made so much sense as something that was gonna be.

[00:17:48] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Vetted and uh, and reusable and you weren't, and people weren't reinventing the wheel every time they wanted to do something. That would, the idea of library in computing, and it's so not [00:18:00] a computer thing, that all the time when I would say to people what they've worked on, I would use the word libraries and they would, if non computing people would just be like, they thought I meant a building that was a library.

[00:18:10] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It's like, no, you can have a software library. You can, you can automate, you can, you can reuse things. You can make plug and play. And it was, uh, just not the way anybody thought about coding. Coding was like, you learn a foreign language and then you write your novel in that language, in your, in your own [00:18:30] way, your own style.

[00:18:31] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** But I don't think any of us really had a clue that boost was turned out to matter. 

[00:18:35] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** No, 

[00:18:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** I mean, I mean, the initial idea cut. Beman had a goal. He, he wanted to go and improve the C++ standard with more libraries. Mm-hmm. You were there from the beginning. I was not, 

[00:18:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** well, not the very first Genesis, but, yeah.

[00:18:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** But early, you, you were certainly there very early. 

[00:18:57] **DOUG GREGOR:** I, I looked it up. I started about [00:19:00] 2000. Um, and so Boost was going, sounds about right. And, uh, 

[00:19:06] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** it, it had been a year 

[00:19:07] **DOUG GREGOR:** or something. Maybe only been a year or so. Yeah. And there were a handful. We were still figuring out like how to review cross review code and, and how to like, make a process that produced good libraries instead of just Yeah.

[00:19:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** Whatever we came up with. 

[00:19:21] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And, 

[00:19:22] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** and, right. I mean, 

[00:19:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** no version control. 

[00:19:25] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** I, 

[00:19:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I don't even remember how we, how we exchanged 

[00:19:28] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** our 

[00:19:28] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** code, [00:19:30] but this was, I am pretty sure this was before we got into CVS. Um. I, 

[00:19:39] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think we put Tarballs up on Source Forge back in 

[00:19:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** back in, yeah. Yeah. It was Source, forge, source for Sounds familiar.

[00:19:46] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And yeah, I didn't want take, take the thing away from you guys, but, but I 

[00:19:55] **DOUG GREGOR:** just 

[00:19:55] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** wanted to, to mention that as far as knowing that it was gonna be [00:20:00] significant at that time, you remember c plus plus was, was struggling, right. We, it sort of looked like Java was taking over the world. 

[00:20:08] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:20:09] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and so 

[00:20:11] **DOUG GREGOR:** contributing to C++ didn't look like a, 

[00:20:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** a way to make a big dent in anything, right?

[00:20:16] **DOUG GREGOR:** No. 

[00:20:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It was all 

[00:20:17] **AMY GREGOR:** about 

[00:20:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** design patterns and, and objects and, 

[00:20:21] **DOUG GREGOR:** oh, yes. The time of the, uh, the Gang of four book with his design patterns book that everyone is required to, to purchase. Yeah, 

[00:20:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I went to [00:20:30] ULA and it was all that anybody wanted to talk about. Yes. 

[00:20:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** So it was, 

[00:20:36] **AMY GREGOR:** we got married in 2000. Did Yeah. So that was like the start of boost and the start of the marriage.

[00:20:41] **AMY GREGOR:** But we had known each other since high school. So it's, um, but I think they all 

[00:20:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** have been together maybe longer than we have. 

[00:20:47] **AMY GREGOR:** It's fun. Yeah. I think it's as high school, um, times we knew each other, but then I think because I'm a social worker, so I'm not even in the world of computer science, but I can, when you're talking I understand what you're saying.

[00:20:59] **AMY GREGOR:** [00:21:00] 'cause I've been around him for enough years. You help. But yeah, you, 

[00:21:03] **DOUG GREGOR:** you 

[00:21:04] **AMY GREGOR:** can 

[00:21:04] **DOUG GREGOR:** talk a good computer 

[00:21:04] **AMY GREGOR:** science too. Yeah, I can. I can, I can. But I To travel for book. Yeah. Well I didn't get that far. Oh, she has 

[00:21:10] **DOUG GREGOR:** refused to read my book. Huh. 

[00:21:12] **AMY GREGOR:** But it's a point. But I mean, it's pretty fun because Right. I'm going to my college things and working and watching in free time.

[00:21:21] **AMY GREGOR:** He was working on Boost and all the PhD stuff and then moving to Indiana. But [00:21:30] it, you know, it's always there as something important to you. So I learned a lot about that, and I got to travel to some of the conferences. Mm-hmm. Like I know you went to one in Kona. 

[00:21:40] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:21:40] **AMY GREGOR:** And then the 

[00:21:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Kona, the 

[00:21:42] **AMY GREGOR:** Kona 

[00:21:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Kona conferences were very significant in my life too.

[00:21:46] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:21:46] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:21:47] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** The standard committees meetings. There was a time when there was a, like a good, uh, cohort of spouses mm-hmm. That would come. And we, um, did some fun [00:22:00] socializing. That was nice. Um, it was always like, where, where's the conference? Is that somewhere I want to go? Right. 

[00:22:08] **DOUG GREGOR:** Oh yeah. I had a great time with Hawaii.

[00:22:09] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It was like Kona. Oh yeah. Co Copenhagen sign me up. Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:22:13] **AMY GREGOR:** But I do think, I don't know, it's, it's nice because the boost, I, I forget about all the people that we are friends with or we're more connected to. That were involved in your projects too. 

[00:22:27] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:22:28] **AMY GREGOR:** So like Jeremy and you, [00:22:30] and we got to know each other through that way.

[00:22:33] **AMY GREGOR:** Do you still do the Hawaiian, um, music? 

[00:22:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. That's 

[00:22:36] **AMY GREGOR:** like, 

[00:22:37] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah. And I, I was wondering whether to say anything the, the Kona conferences 

[00:22:44] **AMY GREGOR:** mm-hmm. 

[00:22:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** In part are responsible for my discovering Hawaiian music and Swipey guitar. 

[00:22:53] **AMY GREGOR:** It's a bright group that you all hung out with and Ron, right. Um, very bright group. And [00:23:00] I, it makes you wish you were a computer science major, but I'm not.

[00:23:03] **AMY GREGOR:** And so, I don't know. You did the function, um, thing and boost and I just, I don't know. I'm on the peripheral, so I, but, but I had fun knowing that he was having a, you know, connection to community. 

[00:23:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:23:18] **AMY GREGOR:** You know, and how it fits in with C++. I always was just interested in that. 

[00:23:21] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um. 

[00:23:24] **AMY GREGOR:** You know, and then you made a business out of it.

[00:23:25] **AMY GREGOR:** So that was kind of a good thing that it was that successful that it [00:23:30] needed. Right. 

[00:23:31] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** That was two, 2001 in the fall, um, when, uh, he got, had been approached by somebody, somebody asking if he knew anybody who could work on this grant funded, uh, project. Um, and, and he was available. So we did that and it lasted a year and it was kind of like, wow, maybe there's, we can, you know, make a go of it.

[00:23:58] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And because I had a, [00:24:00] a job that at the university with really good benefits that kind of took care of that side of it. Um, that's how, how Boost Consulting started and then eventually became Boost Pro Incorporated 2007. So when we just had, yeah, it went from Dave, uh, working on projects. For the IU guys too, having all the IU guys be our subcontractors.

[00:24:24] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** So that was, that was like, yeah, okay. This is a thing. Yeah. Yeah. So [00:24:30] 

[00:24:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, it was, that was cool for 10 years. And then, then I went to Apple to work with Doug. 

[00:24:35] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, 

[00:24:35] **AMY GREGOR:** yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a community. It's a community though. I was asking him on the way here, I'm like, is this still around? And it's an interesting question.

[00:24:43] **AMY GREGOR:** I don't, you know, 'cause people move on a little bit with their jobs and life and kids and all the things. So, you know, you keep in touch with a lot of the folks and the concept of having things that you can keep forever has [00:25:00] remained in your repertoire of, of coding. Right. That's, that's all I hear about.

[00:25:06] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Starting over from scratch every time. 

[00:25:08] **AMY GREGOR:** Right, right, right. But the plug and play, or making it safe or, you know, I, I understand a little bit of that and the, the concepts are relevant today.

[00:25:21] **AMY GREGOR:** But you said like Boost is in like how everything still 

[00:25:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, it's 

[00:25:24] **AMY GREGOR:** everywhere. So like my phone, like, it's 

[00:25:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. I, I was saying like, [00:25:30] when did you start to realize that it was a big thing? Mm. Because I don't remember, I don't remember the year that it happened, but I started to notice the, the Boost software license showing up in, in startup screens everywhere.

[00:25:46] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And yes, it was like, whoa, this 

[00:25:48] **DOUG GREGOR:** is everywhere. 

[00:25:49] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** What the 

heck is 

[00:25:50] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** going on? 

[00:25:52] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. I, I think, uh, when I started working on compilers, then I would find everyone using Boost everywhere. Mm-hmm. And say, [00:26:00] oh, I've seen this before. Ah, everyone's using this. Okay. It's sort of, yeah, grew far beyond what I would anticipated.

[00:26:09] **DOUG GREGOR:** And I think the first inkling was, you know, way back when we succeeded at getting something into the standard. Mm-hmm. That was Beam's goal, right. To go. Build a community that would incubate these libraries and then improve the standard and you know, bring some life to C++. 

[00:26:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. But that wasn't until 2011.

[00:26:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. So I think Boost itself. Yeah. I think Boost [00:26:30] was, yeah, I think Boost was a big deal long before that. 

[00:26:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think it was, I was thinking of the technical report being sort of the, 

[00:26:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** oh, 

[00:26:40] **DOUG GREGOR:** first time we sort of changed the direction of C++ through, through groups. Yeah. 

[00:26:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** What 

[00:26:47] **DOUG GREGOR:** So it was early. So, uh, the first libraries we did 

[00:26:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, right.

[00:26:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** Was my first committee meeting. 'cause I hadn't been on the committee. I was, you know, a student and I met all you folks online through [00:27:00] Boost. 

[00:27:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:27:00] **DOUG GREGOR:** And showed up at committee meeting because, uh, the committee was starting this library technical report process to build new libraries. 

[00:27:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. So the idea was to, to sort of unofficially enshrine.

[00:27:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** What we thought we were gonna get in the next standard. And a bunch of Boost libraries got into the tr right. And yeah, 

[00:27:21] **DOUG GREGOR:** I feel like it was, it was a test for Boost in a sense. Like can this process work in a way that that actually affects the standard? And [00:27:30] it did. Right. So my first meeting was the meeting where function and Tuple, uh, were discussed and voted on.

[00:27:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Function was yours, but Function 

[00:27:43] **AMY GREGOR:** was mine. 

[00:27:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:27:44] **AMY GREGOR:** Tuple was Jaako. 

[00:27:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yako. Right. So Jaako. Yeah. And were you working with Jaako by that time point? 

[00:27:51] **DOUG GREGOR:** I had only, I mean, online we were chatting, but I had never met him before. I was still at Reser as a student and he was at Indiana, I think, at the time. Mm-hmm. [00:28:00] 

[00:28:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right.

[00:28:02] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's all online, I think. Yeah. It's all online. Okay. I got excited about generic programming because I learned about it at school. Uh, it helps that David Muer was at RPI. 

[00:28:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, you had it taught, right? 

[00:28:15] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes. Somebody who actually understood it. Yes. Which there were 

[00:28:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** still are. Precious few. 

[00:28:21] **DOUG GREGOR:** There are. Um, but he, he had worked with Alex and so I learned it that way and got very excited and I think I just found [00:28:30] Boost as like, oh, here's an online community that gets generic programming.

[00:28:33] **DOUG GREGOR:** These are my people. This is, 

[00:28:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** did we though, did we really get it? 

[00:28:38] **DOUG GREGOR:** Some of you did. 

[00:28:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I I think we did. I didn't get it for, for quite a few years. I think I got some of it. I got some of it, but, you know, I, I don't know. I, I guess I keep thinking this because, because Alex, you know, never thinks that anybody [00:29:00] understands his his thing well enough, you know, because.

[00:29:04] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** He's got very high standards. Yes. 

[00:29:07] **AMY GREGOR:** But you start out kind of like just talking to people online and trying to discover what the problems are. 

[00:29:11] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. And build things. And I, you know, I had been hacking on a little library in my spare time and so I offered up like, Hey, what does everyone think? And people liked it and they gave me better.

[00:29:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. They gave me good suggestions on how to make it, improve it. And like, that's the fun part, right? When 

[00:29:27] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:29:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** A whole bunch of smart people are helping you make your [00:29:30] ideas work better. It's like no competition, it was just all focused on this. Like, we want to build the best thing that we know how to build.

[00:29:39] **AMY GREGOR:** Was it considered open source? Oh 

yeah. 

[00:29:41] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah. That was a big, that's a big 

[00:29:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** deal. We had no license, but it was, but it was, you know, the agreement was, you know, take it and use it. Um, because that was the whole point was to get a lot of people using it. But the, um, yeah. Um. I, I [00:30:00] think that that process of like getting the feedback and, and everybody working toward this goal was like another kind of validation for me that, that you can actually produce great things by consensus, you know?

[00:30:19] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[00:30:20] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and the committee worked like that for, for many years. Mm-hmm. Um, I'm not sure, I'm not sure that it kept [00:30:30] functioning well, but, um, yeah, I think yako with the type traits that, that kind of blew me away. Right. That was Yoko's work, wasn't it? 

[00:30:38] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yako did a lot of, yeah, the work there. He did a lot of work on Lambdas and on, like taking these functional programming idioms from other languages and finding a way to express them in C++, we didn't know was possible to do it in such a clean manner.

[00:30:54] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:30:55] **DOUG GREGOR:** I mean, I think. What is the secret sauce? I think a lot of it is comes down to [00:31:00] people, um, you know, very smart people. They're collaborating. And it was a fun time for I think C++ the language because we were discovering ways to use it that hadn't been intended and hadn't been known before.

[00:31:16] **DOUG GREGOR:** And so, you know, that's true. Every couple of months someone found a new technique, it's like, wow, now we can express this new idea better. That's true. We can, we can build a better library than we knew we could. 

[00:31:26] **AMY GREGOR:** That happened over 

[00:31:26] **DOUG GREGOR:** and over again. Oh, it did. 

[00:31:28] **AMY GREGOR:** And and that's 

[00:31:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** like [00:31:30] because of the properties of, of C++ that, that we probably are running out of our, of our languages these days be, be right.

[00:31:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** They're the same, they're the same properties that, that make C++ so hard for people to work with correctly. Yes. Um, you know, also. That also lead to these kind of amazing tricks that you can do. Right. 

[00:31:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's a, it's a great, it's a playground for experts to be, be able to explore things and, [00:32:00] you know, we had a group of experts that were very motivated to, motivated to work together.

[00:32:04] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yep. 

[00:32:04] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. And actually go and try out these techniques. 

[00:32:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** What do you think motivated us? Was it just the ex excitement of discovering new things? I was, 

[00:32:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** that was me. Yeah. I, I just, 

[00:32:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah. 

[00:32:16] **DOUG GREGOR:** It was really fun to like, try out these techniques, try to go and build interface. Like the interface design part of it really appealed to me.

[00:32:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, 

[00:32:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** it still does. And yeah, that we could build better [00:32:30] interfaces and then someone would come up with a new technique and would say, oh, that's so much better. I'd go redo everything I did based on this new idea. And I'd explore and, and learn new stuff. 

[00:32:38] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. So making. 

[00:32:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Making libraries that were more and more usable, more expressive, would require less, less code from users.

[00:32:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, I mean, I was, I was saying that, um, yesterday that, that the fundamental thing was like, [00:33:00] I think was the whole thing was a, was a, a game of discovery, right? Mm-hmm. Dis discovering some truth, um, at, at the best moments you're discovering some kind of platonic truth, right? And, and, but then there's also, you know, just discovering what, what this weird machine called C++ can do.

[00:33:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. Right? 

[00:33:28] **DOUG GREGOR:** Like the description is a weird machine [00:33:30] because that's, that, that's what it was. It's a weird machine. Yeah. No one really knew all the things it could do, and so we were finding new ones. 

[00:33:38] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. You actually, you actually built that machine. When you did client Plus plus. 

[00:33:43] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:33:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** I mean, you know, eventually wanted to go and build a new implementation to do a better job of evaluating that machine.

[00:33:51] **DOUG GREGOR:** And so ended up on the, on the other side as a implementer of the language rather than a [00:34:00] user of the language 

[00:34:01] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** ing. 

[00:34:01] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:34:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And that, I would say, I would say the impact of clang is easily as, as big as, as boost itself. 

[00:34:14] **AMY GREGOR:** But you had to have a separate group, like Boost, you had to have a separate boost to get the innovation.

[00:34:20] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I think we had to, 

[00:34:21] **DOUG GREGOR:** yeah. I think the, the c plus plus committee of the time was not set up to innovate or try ideas like this. I mean, [00:34:30] 

[00:34:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** right. 

[00:34:30] **DOUG GREGOR:** And in some sense it, it was hard, like it shouldn't have been. 'cause standards committees should not invent per se, they should. Take what is known to work well and enshrine it so everyone can build on it.

[00:34:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** And we couldn't have standardized anything early because we were changing our minds every couple weeks. Right, right. Like, oh, they've made a really good point in this post. I'm gonna go redo all this stuff and come back and see if it works. 

[00:34:55] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:34:55] **DOUG GREGOR:** And this, this happened a lot. I mean, um, I was [00:35:00] remembering, uh, you know, a few of the times that like things really shifted.

[00:35:03] **DOUG GREGOR:** I remember hearing about when you and Jeremy and others invented the, the is edible technique. I believe it was you, wasn't it? Jeremy? Might have 

[00:35:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** been. 

[00:35:15] **DOUG GREGOR:** I believe you, you invented. So as I recall the story, it was, uh, it was fina, but it was fina for the purposes of detecting whether something was possible or not.

[00:35:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** Okay. Without breaking the compile. I thought you, you folks invented it in the pool at au [00:35:30] and I only heard I couldn't go to auo because I was a poor student and I was, I was feeling very left out of this like, amazing discovery that changed the way we did programming because I couldn't go. Well. 

[00:35:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, we had a lot of, we had a lot of, uh, our crowd would get together in a, in a hot tub and, and talk about stuff and, uh, 

[00:35:52] **DOUG GREGOR:** for the best thinking comes, 

[00:35:54] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I, I don't remember that it is, if we came out [00:36:00] up with that out of thin air without like a computer in front of us, I am, I'm amazed that, I mean, I'm no longer, you know, I used to be an expert in c plus plus, I'm no longer, um, uh, but I don't ever think I was that good.

[00:36:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** What's the story behind? It's a typo. 

[00:36:19] **DOUG GREGOR:** Okay. 

[00:36:20] **AMY GREGOR:** The, you had a shirt that said it's a typo. I still don't quite get it, but mm-hmm. There's a lot of, like, if you say it, you go, Hmm. Like if I said that to Ron, [00:36:30] everybody would laugh, right? 

[00:36:31] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. I mean, I just remember the shirt. Not that I understand. We're trying to find it.

[00:36:34] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I never was in on that joke. I don't 

[00:36:36] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** think it, yeah. The, it's a typo T-shirt. I I know you had it. Yeah, 

[00:36:40] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I had it. Yeah. I had the shirt. 

[00:36:42] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, I remember it. 

[00:36:43] **AMY GREGOR:** It's like a boost thing, right? Does it still 

[00:36:46] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** exist? Do you, I could not find, do you remember what it is 

[00:36:49] **AMY GREGOR:** I probably have a picture of? Yeah. 

[00:36:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So what's the story behind it?

[00:36:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It's a typo. 

[00:36:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** Okay. So it was this, this first Santa Cruz meeting where we were taking the first two [00:37:00] boost libraries and trying to get them approved for the, the technical report part of the standard. Mm-hmm. And, um, we ran into some trouble with KO's, uh, proposal for tubals. And the trouble is the way he had specified it sort of implied a whole lot of strange template meta programming tricks that us sp people were totally comfortable with.

[00:37:24] **DOUG GREGOR:** And the rest of the committee being folks [00:37:30] that had responsible for the implementations of these things wanted to move slower, make sure things were proven out 

[00:37:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** right. 

[00:37:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** Were very nervous about this. 

[00:37:37] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. 

[00:37:38] **DOUG GREGOR:** Jeremy correctly read the room as going sort of against Yoko's proposal and said, don't worry everyone, it's okay.

[00:37:46] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's just a typo. He actually meant to write it like this and wrote down something that was very boring and simple. It was around the get access or something. It, it's, I, the actual technical detail, I don't recall. 

[00:37:59] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:37:59] **DOUG GREGOR:** [00:38:00] But it was something that turned this like very scary, very, you know, boost thing into something normal that everyone understood.

[00:38:09] **DOUG GREGOR:** So it, and it got the conversation back. 

[00:38:11] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Sorry. 

[00:38:11] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So it implied all that template meta programming or, or that was actually shown in the paper. 

[00:38:17] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think it implied it 

[00:38:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** so people thought 

[00:38:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** it and trying to describe 

[00:38:22] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** it. This is magic. Yeah. How can we possibly do this? 

[00:38:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. So describe this way. I believe that Yako went off and like [00:38:30] described all of the meta programming behind the implementation and everyone dies glazed over.

[00:38:34] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. This is where Jeremy realized like, yeah, we have a problem. And it is just a typo. Just it's like this, don't worry. And sort of brought it back 

[00:38:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** simply is like Yeah. Was totally key to getting anything through the committee. Absolutely. Right. Yeah. So I think at that point he, he, 

[00:38:51] **DOUG GREGOR:** he saved, you know, this one proposal could've come back, but he, he saved it at that point and I think probably helped the boost cause quite a lot, [00:39:00] uh, in that, you know, the things that we started out with were actually successful.

[00:39:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Luann told me, uh, told me what her mother said, uh, about what you, what you say. Uh. That, that you shouldn't ever say anything you don't want plastered across the front page of the paper. So, so yeah, I don't, I don't have any, uh, desire to make an enemy of bona, even though it probably doesn't matter [00:39:30] at this point.

[00:39:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, yeah. So how do we tell this story? 

[00:39:38] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** I think you can honestly say that it was, it was contentious. 

[00:39:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:39:44] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Not saying you can't discuss that, but yeah, 

[00:39:47] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** it was absolutely contentious. That's the, okay, we're done. That's the whole story. I have gone over this story on a podcast, so I'm not afraid of it. Publish 

[00:39:57] **AMY GREGOR:** a committee solely there with their [00:40:00] hearts to like support, like the language of c plus plus, right?

[00:40:04] **AMY GREGOR:** Or the world of computer science. But then there was like a little bit of conflict, but maybe that's just what growth is. I don't know. Oh, I guess, I don't know. I don't know the concept. I remember the concepts. That's very 

[00:40:16] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** generous. 

[00:40:18] **AMY GREGOR:** I do remember a little bit of it. Yeah. But from an outsider, 

[00:40:22] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** I mean, 

[00:40:23] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I know Bjarne's got a tough road to hoe, and I don't know if, I don't know if Alex talked about, uh, [00:40:30] about Bjarne um, in, in his interview, but that, but let me just, let me set the stage a little bit before we start talking about like, the actual events that that happened.

[00:40:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So one of the things that was pointed out to me not long ago is, is, uh, you know, Bjarne doesn't have a tour award. Okay. And, and I was, you know, my first reaction was, well, [00:41:00] should he have a tour award? And, you know, I mean, is that computer science? Well, Nicholas Vert has a Turing award for Pascal? Um, or, or was it modular two?

[00:41:12] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I don't know. But, and like, this is a, people that have written influential languages have, have been awarded touring awards for that. And there is, and it would be totally, [00:41:30] you know, it's, it's ridiculous to think that that c plus plus isn't as influential as any of those. Mm-hmm. I think it's more influential than mm-hmm.

[00:41:40] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Than probably any other language that's out there now. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, both in terms of learning lessons from it and, and doing something different and, and in terms of what it has accomplished and, and bi. So that's part of it. Another, another part of the stage for Bjarne is [00:42:00] that, uh, academia hates c plus plus.

[00:42:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. They hate it with a passion. And, and you know, Bjarne is, has been in and out of academia and, and, uh, you know, it, it's, it's a bias that, that prevents, prevents what you think of as legitimate computer science being done in, in the area of c plus plus. 

[00:42:28] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Can you, in a [00:42:30] nutshell say why academia hates c plus plus so much for the, is it for the reasons that we Okay.

[00:42:36] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:42:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** Well, 

[00:42:38] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** in a sense, it's unclean and inelegant. Mm-hmm. Right? It's c plus plus is an extremely practical language. Mm-hmm. It started with, it started with C and was, was grown organically. Yes. And, and, um, you know, it's, it's very, [00:43:00] it. For, for academics who like, you know, pure functional programming that looks like a direct expression of mathematics, c plus plus is nothing like that.

[00:43:12] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** That didn't, there's 

no 

[00:43:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** underlying theory that that, that you can base c plus plus on. So it's hard to reason about it in a formal sense that can support research. That's also a 

[00:43:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** really good point. So, I mean, and it's, it, it would be hard for them, but that's a [00:43:30] technical argument and, and there was like people just openly out loud loathed it and, right.

[00:43:40] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And so, so I think, I think there are two things. So, so I, I think that Bjarne for a lot of his career has felt like under assault from all sides. Um, and, and not recognized for his contribution and, um. [00:44:00] And, you know, unfortunately, sometimes I think he doesn't, he doesn't realize who his allies are. Mm-hmm. Um, and feels under assault from them too.

[00:44:10] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, anyway, that's my, that's my, uh, my scene setting. Yeah. And that's good. So, so, and I guess I'll, I'll give the, the intro. So concepts was this feature that was, uh, that was [00:44:30] designed to support the kind of Well, that's, that's funny. So, um, so there was a desire to support the, the kind of programming that Alex had invented.

[00:44:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. Better than what c plus plus did. Mm-hmm. Uh, that's how I can say it. And, and, uh, Bjarne and, and Gabby GDR and his crew had that desire and we all had that desire. Mm-hmm. But we had very different ideas of. [00:45:00] How to approach it. And Doug, it's all you. 

[00:45:05] **DOUG GREGOR:** Okay. Uh, so yeah, so, right. We wanted, we wanted to make c plus plus even better for generic programming in a sense.

[00:45:14] **DOUG GREGOR:** This is what brought us all together. Yeah. Initially brought many of us into the boost realm, was this idea of generic programming. We could do it successfully in c plus plus, but it was hard and inelegant. It, it, I almost think of it as there's this very elegant [00:45:30] theory and this horribly inelegant practice beneath it.

[00:45:33] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yep. And the idea of concepts is let's elevate the practice so that it's close to the theory and so that, you know, the ideas that we talk about, concepts and generic algorithms and so on, you could write directly in c plus plus and the language would help you. 

[00:45:48] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Okay. So the reason I, the reason I stopped when I was, when I was introducing this is 'cause.

[00:45:55] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I know that was, that was your idea of concepts. I, I [00:46:00] don't know that that was Texas's idea of concepts. Like were they trying to make the practice close to the theory? 

[00:46:09] **DOUG GREGOR:** Don't, no, I think there's alternative things that aren't that, that are, we wanna make the error messages better, or we wanna make it so that more programmers can write this code and not get upset and walk away, which are equally valid reasons.

[00:46:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think we would probably say that falls out of the theory, [00:46:30] right? Having, having a sound model underneath makes all of those problems easy to solve. Right. 

[00:46:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So I think, uh, like we saw this at the, at, at some point Bjarne brought a proposal for, and that was in Lillehammer, I think, um, brought a proposal for, for concepts for c plus plus and.

[00:46:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And I think, I think what Doug just said, cap really captures like [00:47:00] the difference. His, the, that whole proposal seemed to start with, with,

[00:47:12] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I don't know, let's figure out the most, the most sugary and, and palatable way to, to express these ideas. And to a lot of us it seemed like, [00:47:30] like, but, but the fundamentals aren't there. Right. We, we thought we had. We had, you know, after, at least for me, it was like after a, a lot of years of, of thinking and trying to, trying to grasp the ideas better come to understand what the, what the fundamental principles were.

[00:47:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And we didn't think that they were, that didn't seem to be the primary concern of this proposal that Brianna brought. 

[00:47:57] **DOUG GREGOR:** Correct. And so, um, [00:48:00] we, uh, I was at Indiana at the time, uh, had taken a job in Andrew Lumsdaine's Laboratory at Indiana University with Jeremy Siek and Ron Garcia and many other Boost folks.

[00:48:11] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yako was there as well. And so we came up with an alternative competing proposal for our own design of how we thought generic programming and concepts would fit into the, the language. Um, I remember it very clearly because I gave a [00:48:30] live demo coding with this. So we went off and implemented our ideas. 

[00:48:35] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** No, but that was, that was, there was quite a bit of time between 

[00:48:40] **DOUG GREGOR:** six months.

[00:48:41] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah, there's six months and so we really, 

[00:48:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** between l Hummer and your Yeah, and the Montre, where 

[00:48:46] **DOUG GREGOR:** Montre Long I think was, yeah, 

[00:48:48] **AMY GREGOR:** you assumed that. Like, like, like just pretend it existed and I'm just gonna make something to, to show people how it works. 

[00:48:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** I think we had a design for Lily Hummer and we had talked about it a bit.

[00:48:57] **DOUG GREGOR:** So we had a design we thought was pretty good, but we [00:49:00] realized no one is going to, 

[00:49:02] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I didn't think 

[00:49:02] **DOUG GREGOR:** so. Get how it changed things unless we actually had an implementation that we could show it and play with it. And because there's a, there's a difference where like, it's a different feel and it's hard to get that across.

[00:49:15] **DOUG GREGOR:** Like you can look at code and say, well, this code looks nice and this code doesn't look nice, but it, the differences between these ideas were one step further of what is the experience of using it. 

[00:49:27] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I think there was that. [00:49:30] I, so, so first, did you guys present your proposal at Lela Hunger? I 

[00:49:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** think we did.

[00:49:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Okay. I I have no memory of that. I, the, I have the memory of, of Bjarne's presentation and being very uncomfortable when I was asking like, don't you wanna do something that's kind of a little closer to the fundamental ideas? And yeah, he wasn't happy with that, but, but, um, I, I think the programming [00:50:00] experience is part of it.

[00:50:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** But the other part of it was the more we looked at, at the, the things that Bjarne was saying, should, should, you know the code that should work, we keep kept concluding that there was no way to implement it. Right? And, and Implementability is a huge test in the committee, right? You need to be able to show that you can actually, actually build this thing that you're gonna [00:50:30] standardize and.

[00:50:32] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And so Doug did this amazing thinking, like hacking up this design in inside of GC to make, to make it so you could actually use the thing. 

[00:50:45] **AMY GREGOR:** What's the difference between like having Ade academia, like just making it in-house and just trying to think about the theory and then having Boost is like it's meant to be used.

[00:50:55] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yep. 

[00:50:55] **AMY GREGOR:** Right? You want, it's meant to be used. So 

[00:50:58] **DOUG GREGOR:** yeah. The, the [00:51:00] boost ethos, I would say 

[00:51:00] **AMY GREGOR:** it's not just a theory. 

[00:51:02] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's very much build it. And hand it out for people to try it and give you feedback. 'cause that's, that's the only way we knew how to make things better. And that's what we've been doing in Boost since the beginning is like, here's the thing, please try it and tell me what can be better.

[00:51:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:51:16] **DOUG GREGOR:** And people did that and so we felt, 

[00:51:18] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** and only when a lot of people are using it, then you think about standardizing it. 

[00:51:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right? 

[00:51:23] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. 

[00:51:23] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. But you have to get that feedback. 'cause without that feedback loop, you can design yourself into something that doesn't make sense. Either it doesn't make sense for the user, you [00:51:30] better to build it for, or it doesn't, you can't actually do that.

[00:51:34] **DOUG GREGOR:** And you know, when you're implementing it, if you can't do it, you realize really quick that I can't do it. Right. 

[00:51:40] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[00:51:40] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And it seems to me from, at the time, uh, the, be the beginning of that. A time when Dave started getting involved with the, the committee, I, we had been working at an architecture firm and it was like this idea of, you know, architects do a design review and they, and they take the feedback.

[00:51:57] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It's not to just show their pretty thing that [00:52:00] they're there. They're sort of like, this is where we got to with this concept. And then sometimes people are like, very validating and then keep doing what you're doing. And sometimes somebody asks a question that takes it in a whole other direction, which is, it just seems like it's that environment that coding, it's engineering.

[00:52:17] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** It should have that feedback loop. And, and it often doesn't. And I still meet people who work in programming who scoff at the idea of documentation and code review. And I'm sort of like coming from an outside perspective, I'm like, [00:52:30] but don't you like, don't you want somebody else's. Input and, and, and obviously not everybody gets the same respectful, uh, collegial feedback.

[00:52:42] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** That was sort of the hallmark of Boost and not, not just because of Beman, but because of the, the, you know, the culture there of yeah, we all wanna do this thing and make it better. 

[00:52:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** How much do you think today people think of, of coding as a solitary activity? I mean, 'cause what, [00:53:00] what you described, it's like, like community was a huge part of what this whole process was about.

[00:53:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Right. I think you couldn't do it without other people. 

[00:53:10] **DOUG GREGOR:** No, you couldn't because you knew they had great ideas for you if you got stuck or they would find someplace where you designed something that didn't way, 

[00:53:18] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** or, or they know of a use case that you may not be familiar with that would have like a completely different, you know 

[00:53:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right.

[00:53:26] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** The users for it. The users are the pe are also people contributing to the, to the [00:53:30] success. Right. Right. 

[00:53:31] **AMY GREGOR:** And you did it through Boost with the open source stuff? Yeah, but like with c plus plus open source, 

[00:53:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** I mean, it's an open standard and anyone can come with proposals, but I think, 

[00:53:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** but it was still not free.

[00:53:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right? 

[00:53:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** Wow. 

[00:53:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** You can only 

[00:53:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** fair, 

[00:53:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** you can only download a draft. I think that was a big obstacle for a lot of people for a long time. 

[00:53:52] **DOUG GREGOR:** I, I think at one time that was, I think the bigger obstacle is that it's not set up for the same kind of [00:54:00] feedback cycle that improves things. And some of it is almost unsolvable because you have a very large group.

[00:54:08] **DOUG GREGOR:** It was. 50 to a hundred people, maybe more like 50 people when we started. It's grown to, I believe, over 200 now. Oh, the meetings are massive right now. Yeah. 

[00:54:19] **AMY GREGOR:** C plus plus committee, 

[00:54:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** the c plus plus committee, and they meet two to three times a year. And so it's very high stakes. You come with your proposal, you get your 15 minutes of allocated [00:54:30] time, and then if you need to make changes, it's another four to six months before you get another shot at it.

[00:54:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** And, 

[00:54:38] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** and honestly, like nobody else, nobody else in the meeting really has the time to evaluate the proposal in that, in those 15 minutes. Right. And you know, you're supposed to, like, the proposal goes out in a mailing ahead of time. And if, you know, I, I tried to read the mailings, I tried to read at least the, the parts I was [00:55:00] interested in.

[00:55:00] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. 

[00:55:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Uh, and, but, uh, but that's, that's hard too, right? It's not the, not the same as evaluate by. By actually using the thing in the wild, right? Mm-hmm. That's a completely different thing. It 

[00:55:12] **DOUG GREGOR:** wasn't, I say, I think there was an interesting inflection point. Yeah. Where we started out building libraries and we were very successful at the Boost project as a whole.

[00:55:23] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. In building libraries. That worked very well and moving those into the standard. Now as we did this, we [00:55:30] realized that the language could be better and could support our library building activities so much better. And many of us that were involved in Boost and on the committee, we pivoted. Right? We started writing language proposals.

[00:55:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** You were doing move semantics. Mm-hmm. I was doing very templates. Mm-hmm. And you know, eventually we had this grand goal of, well, let's do generic programming, this massive task and. So, you know, we had put forth our [00:56:00] proposal, uh, for, for concepts, our view of it. Uh, we did the implementation work and we showed it off in this, this live demo.

[00:56:07] **DOUG GREGOR:** I remember that very well. Yeah. It was just me with an editor projecting on a screen and talking through, like, here is the process of doing generic programming, the way we envision it working for people and building up an algorithm. Yeah. You know, from a very concrete thing to finding the abstractions and the c plus plus compiler with concepts was [00:56:30] helping you along the way to, to get it right.

[00:56:32] **DOUG GREGOR:** And I feel like that was one of the best presentations I've ever given. It was very, you know, just very chill with an editor. There were no slides. There was, you know, no big statements. Just like, here's the experience. And I've heard from many people that like, that just opened their eyes to, wow, this could be something better.

[00:56:51] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And I, and I want, I want to just, uh. Interject that like one of the big differences between the [00:57:00] what you were bringing and what and, and what c plus plus eventually ended up with is what c plus plus ended up with. Didn't make the experience better for generic programmers. It didn't, it didn't change that, it changed the experience for other other users.

[00:57:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** But, but this was the key thing that we cared about because in, in Boost we were doing generic programming and you know, in some ways I think most codes should be done that way. Um, [00:57:30] we did. Yeah. So anyway, where was that 

[00:57:33] **AMY GREGOR:** presentation? Which one was that? 

[00:57:34] **DOUG GREGOR:** That was in REM law 

[00:57:36] **AMY GREGOR:** law 

[00:57:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** in Canada. In Canada. Um, and it, it was amazing because I feel like at that point a lot of people thought, wow, like.

[00:57:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** This is a thing that we will be able to do with c plus plus. Unfortunately, it set us on this path of, now we have two competing proposals that are very different visions, and this is something we try to avoid and boost, right? We [00:58:00] we try to, 

[00:58:01] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, 

[00:58:01] **DOUG GREGOR:** build consensus, build, build consensus, build toward one thing.

[00:58:04] **DOUG GREGOR:** And so we sat on this multi-year, four years or so, three, four year project of trying to, to build toward a unified vision. 

[00:58:15] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Well, okay. I mean, I, I can say this, Pana got extremely upset at this demonstration, right? And I, I think, I think it made him insecure about his proposal because [00:58:30] you actually had a working thing and, and he, he was upset to the point where, where it was clear that he felt disrespected and.

[00:58:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Hmm. And we had a, we had a huddle with, uh, did Andy come later, or was Andy there, or originally Andrew, um, 

[00:58:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** I don't think he was there after, 

[00:58:54] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I think, I think maybe we called him and he, and he flew out or something. Mm-hmm. Um, [00:59:00] but we, you know, we ended up having a huddle with Andrew to try and figure out how to deal with this very, very serious political problem.

[00:59:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, because like, you know, I mean, Bjarne is the leader of c plus plus you, he had his 

[00:59:14] **AMY GREGOR:** own idea that was similar in name, 

[00:59:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** in name and, and uh, sort of intended to address the same general area, um, with very different, very different ethos. Mm. And, and I, I [00:59:30] remember, you know, I thought, I thought we, you know, I think we all thought we hadn't done anything disrespectful.

[00:59:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** But, but I sort of came up with the idea, you know, maybe we could apologize anyway. Mm-hmm. 

[00:59:46] **DOUG GREGOR:** You know? Yeah. 

[00:59:47] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and, you know, whether he deserves an apology or not, let's, let's think about apologizing and, and, and try to try to make this better. [01:00:00] And we did. 

[01:00:01] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[01:00:01] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and, you know, things were patched up. But then, then the, the, the only solution that allowed things to move forward, I think was you and Bjarne going off to try to, to try to build a unified answer.

[01:00:22] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. Right. That, that brought in the things that Bjarne cared about and the things that, um, [01:00:30] Doug cared about and 

[01:00:31] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. So I traveled to Texas a and m. Many times over the next couple of years sat in vi's office with him and just talked through the design. Yeah. Trying to, and trying to hear his concerns about it, make sure that his ideas got incorporated in a way that I didn't feel compromised.

[01:00:52] **DOUG GREGOR:** The, the fundamental model that we built. 

[01:00:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And, and, and this, this wasn't just [01:01:00] going to talk to Bjarne Right. You had a proposal every six months that, which was a large piece of work that you had to write and Yeah. And Bjarne was, you know, signing, he was co-author on the proposal. Mm-hmm. Right. So he was, he was officially signing off on the evolution of this design.

[01:01:20] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. And this, this grew, it was one proposal for the language. And of course, because we're library developers, we also had. Proposals for many of the sections of the [01:01:30] standard library, including bringing this notion of generic programming to the standard template library that sort of started it all Right.

[01:01:37] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yep. That, that Alex had built be for us. That that's the full circle that we wanted because that needed to work that way. Yeah. I mean, at the end, I think each six month period, we had something like a dozen proposals, hundreds of pages total. Probably a dozen. It was something like a dozen. 'cause we had split it up by chapter.

[01:01:56] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. I mean, because the [01:02:00] c plus plus standard is huge and you were trying to address all parts of it. C 

[01:02:03] **DOUG GREGOR:** plus plus standard is 700 some pages at that time. It's much larger now. 

[01:02:07] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:02:07] **DOUG GREGOR:** And it touched on many of those. 

[01:02:09] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. So, um, so this was a, I mean, I, I was totally floored by the amount of work Doug was doing to, to make this happen.

[01:02:18] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:02:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Um, you know, we, uh, we all were very excited about the vision, but I, you know. Personally, I couldn't have done what you were doing. Mm-hmm. And as, [01:02:30] and, you know, negotiating with, with certain, some elements of, of what Bjarne wanted to do were, you know, we thought provably not, couldn't work. Mm-hmm. And, and, you know, sort of bring that into the proposal and then talking to Bjarne about, you know, very, very politically sensitively [01:03:00] about, about why it wasn't gonna work out 

[01:03:02] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** mm-hmm.

[01:03:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And all of that. It was just, I, it was, it was a massive, really impressive. Impressive piece of effort. I 

[01:03:12] **AMY GREGOR:** can't remember. Did it work? I, I can't remember what happened. 

[01:03:15] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Well, uh, well, okay. I guess can get 

[01:03:16] **AMY GREGOR:** those like, I'm hanging on my, but but here's the thing though though, you were trying to like modify a language that wasn't generic.

[01:03:23] **AMY GREGOR:** Programming happy, like friendly. 

[01:03:25] **DOUG GREGOR:** Well, I 

[01:03:25] **AMY GREGOR:** mean, right. Like that was really the end of the battle was like the thing that most [01:03:30] people use wasn't innovative in that generic way. Programming way. Right. Or from a outside. Outside. Dunno, that was the issue. So it, so you had to keep, keep trying to innovate when you couldn't.

[01:03:40] **DOUG GREGOR:** No, I think, I think we did an So it is much easier to build a system from scratch and keep a coherent, it is so much harder to take something that wasn't designed for it. Right. And to retrofit it with the ideas. Right. Right. I think we did an amazing job on it though. Yeah. I mean, we, we found ways to, uh, take the system that we [01:04:00] built that we thought would work pretty well and actually make it work on existing code.

[01:04:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** One of the big things about c plus plus is backward compatibility. 

[01:04:09] **AMY GREGOR:** Right. 

[01:04:09] **DOUG GREGOR:** Existing code needs to work even if you change the language. 

[01:04:11] **AMY GREGOR:** Right. 

[01:04:12] **DOUG GREGOR:** And we managed to get it mostly backward compatible is from an engineering standpoint. Yeah. I think we did an amazing 

[01:04:19] **AMY GREGOR:** job. People still use c plus plus now, so obviously it kept alive.

[01:04:22] **AMY GREGOR:** Like it's an, it's a programming language that's used still. 

[01:04:26] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes. 

[01:04:27] **AMY GREGOR:** Heavily. 

[01:04:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** But it doesn't have this, it doesn't, it doesn't have, 

[01:04:29] **AMY GREGOR:** [01:04:30] okay. So it didn't work. 

[01:04:31] **DOUG GREGOR:** It didn't happen, so, 

[01:04:32] **AMY GREGOR:** okay. I don't remember for some reason, here's part 

[01:04:34] **DOUG GREGOR:** of the story. 

[01:04:35] **AMY GREGOR:** I was in my own 

[01:04:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** It's okay. 

[01:04:37] **AMY GREGOR:** Round. Yeah. 

[01:04:38] **DOUG GREGOR:** It was a long time ago. Uh, I mean, the next part of the story is we succeeded fairly well.

[01:04:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** And so by 2007 or so, we had the design, we had a lot of the library and the committee voted to accept, um, the concepts. Proposal we had. I think I have the time. Right, right. 2007, 2006. Uh, seven would 

[01:04:59] **AMY GREGOR:** be honest. [01:05:00] Don, 

[01:05:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** don't, don't ask me. I'm terrible with that stuff. Okay. I have to say that like I don't re remember an acceptance because, uh, I mean all I re you know, I was just traumatized by Frankfurt.

[01:05:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And, and that's what, that's all I remember. So, ah, okay. Let, so, so you're gonna have to tell the story of how we got from acceptance. Let's 

[01:05:21] **DOUG GREGOR:** go back, we have to rewind back a year. So I guess it was 2008 then. Uh, so we did have, we brought all of the language and the [01:05:30] library to the committee vote and concepts was accepted in its entirety.

[01:05:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** So this joint proposal between, from Bjarne and I with, you know, lots of, lots of thank yous to all of the co-authors from proposals along the way, uh, uh, that added this concepts feature. It's pretty good design, I think. Um, and it's amazing and adopted it in so much of the library. 

[01:05:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It was, it, it was amazing.

[01:05:55] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Esp like, especially given the nature of c [01:06:00] plus plus, like the, the way you walked the line between, between uh, uh, separate checking and, and all of the, all of the weird machine stuff of c plus plus that still need to, needed to be able to operate. So 

[01:06:16] **AMY GREGOR:** anyway, it was approved. 

[01:06:18] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** So was it was approved? 

[01:06:19] **DOUG GREGOR:** It was, remember, so, so it was meeting, it was not, was it San Francisco?

[01:06:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** It may have been beforehand. San [01:06:30] Francisco was late 2008. Francisco was 2008 in the fall. I don't recall whether it was the spring or the fall of that year. Accepted. 

[01:06:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Then what 

[01:06:39] **DOUG GREGOR:** happened? It was merged into the standard, uh, I, I still, I have apologized profusely to Pete Becker, who is the, the editor, editor of the Standard.

[01:06:48] **DOUG GREGOR:** So he merged these hundred plus pages of basically changes, like change this line to this line, this line to this line, into this 800 ish [01:07:00] page document. So much work to do. And then, uh, it was in, we were happy and then things fell apart. So, uh, I dunno, do 

[01:07:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** you falling apart? Well, I mean, I, here, you know, like I said, I have a terrible memory, but, but here's the, what I have in my mind was we were, we were.[01:07:30] 

[01:07:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And just a week before going to the Frankfurt meeting. 

[01:07:35] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:07:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and I think there was, there, there were, there were two ways in which things fell apart. One thing is that the core language people got, got worried about, about whether it could be implemented, uh, efficiently. [01:08:00] Right? 

[01:08:00] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes. 

[01:08:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and because, because, you know, Doug had done this miraculous six months hack on GCC, which was, he did whatever he had to do to get it to work because it was not beautiful.

[01:08:15] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It was a prototype. Right, 

[01:08:16] **DOUG GREGOR:** right. Prototype. 

[01:08:17] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. And, and uh, and they were worried about, about whether they could actually build it. Build it in a way that people could use it. Um, [01:08:30] and so, so there was that concern, but I don't think that was the, the major thing. I think, I think the major thing was about a week before the meeting, BNA wrote a, a message to the c plus plus committee that said, basically, I've been thinking about this and, and it, and, and I can't abide it.

[01:08:58] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** People are gonna hate it. [01:09:00] And, and unless, uh, unless you change it in this way, that was incompatible with the state of the proposal in, into it was something that reflected his original kind of desires. And, and basically he said, he, he actually said, you know, unless you accept this change, I'm pulling my support for this proposal.

[01:09:25] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and there's nothing in a, in a committee setting like [01:09:30] strife to kill a proposal. Right, right. 

[01:09:35] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[01:09:36] **DOUG GREGOR:** But in this case, this case, one of the, the authors of the proposal and the most famous person in this c plus plus world was having second thoughts. And I, I remember giving a, a half-hearted attempt to describe why the change he wanted was unsuitable.

[01:09:53] **AMY GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:09:53] **DOUG GREGOR:** But there was no saving it at that point. Yeah. I realized that pretty quickly. 

[01:09:58] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** He, I, you know, the way I [01:10:00] viewed it was like he had been pushed by reality about what was possible and, and what would work into this position that he, he, you know, just couldn't stand. And, and so he, you know, went around the corner and 

[01:10:18] **AMY GREGOR:** was it just unapproved?

[01:10:19] **AMY GREGOR:** And then it just never happened. After years. 

[01:10:22] **DOUG GREGOR:** Well, this, this is why I, I apologize to, uh, Pete Becker, because then he had to go and unwind the changes. And we had, in [01:10:30] addition to adding concepts and change in library, we had implemented a number of other features on top of concepts that we had had to go unwind, come up with new designs for them.

[01:10:39] **DOUG GREGOR:** I 

don't 

[01:10:39] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** remember that. Huh? 

[01:10:40] **DOUG GREGOR:** The four for each iteration. 

[01:10:44] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, that was 

[01:10:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** on 

[01:10:45] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** top of concepts. 

[01:10:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** That was on top of concepts. So it was, it was a proposal that came in. 

[01:10:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:10:50] **DOUG GREGOR:** Concepts was happening. So we wrote a proposal to describe it in terms of concepts. When concepts got ripped out, I felt bad about someone else's proposal getting [01:11:00] pulled out with it and sort of help them redesign it to the, the design we have today so that that end user feature would still make it into the language.

[01:11:08] **AMY GREGOR:** The toil was worth it though, wasn't it? Just for the process of language design. Well, 

[01:11:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** we had a lot of fun doing it. I, I think we proved out our ideas really well. The fact 

that 

[01:11:18] **DOUG GREGOR:** it worked so well. 

[01:11:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Lot that ended up, up in Swift 

[01:11:22] **AMY GREGOR:** because you were postdoctoral research fellow low stakes, no kids yet you were with just me, um, in [01:11:30] Indiana having kind of this life that was like, not in college, but sort of felt like college.

[01:11:35] **AMY GREGOR:** Right. So you didn't have a lot to lose in your own except for, I mean, 

[01:11:39] **DOUG GREGOR:** just time, but 

[01:11:40] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we weren't like trying to like work another job while you were personal 

[01:11:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** investment in 

[01:11:45] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** design. One piece that I remember from this time is that the committee rightly was staffed by people who worked for big companies that had a lot at stake in c plus plus.

[01:11:57] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And a lot of the politics that happened [01:12:00] happened at a level that had to do with those companies and what those companies, representatives, agendas were. In the mix were also academics or people who were independent or who just did, you know, uh, consulting work like Dave, we moved from company to company.

[01:12:18] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** But there, there was that, this sort of like the idea that the main user base, that's the, that's, uh, the big gorilla was, um, [01:12:30] companies and that how they were gonna react to it. I, and that's, that's what I remember is that was like just part of the, the background. So it was, it couldn't just be, you know, you found this way to do this pure thing side c plus plus and, and put it in there.

[01:12:44] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And then there were people who I think might, but just like, how can we go back and we can't sell this to the home office sort of thing. And that tension I think is, it's there in any language, uh, that's gonna have a robust user [01:13:00] base. But I think that that was. I don't have anybody else that talked about that, but that, that as an outside, as a business person, that's what I 

[01:13:07] **AMY GREGOR:** like.

[01:13:07] **AMY GREGOR:** Too much change without the support to implement it for real. Yeah. In a company isn't, that's why Boost Consulting or those types of companies were probably good, but 

[01:13:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, that's true. 

[01:13:17] **AMY GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:13:18] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And I mean this, I personally, this was a heartbreaking, uh, thing for me. I, I don't, I think it was for Doug too.

[01:13:28] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It was, yeah, 

[01:13:29] **DOUG GREGOR:** it 

[01:13:29] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** absolute [01:13:30] was. And, and, and the, the committee I had already, you know, tried to get the committee to try to like, make some agreement on principles that we were gonna use. And, and so I, and that had failed. And, uh, and so I had already started to see the seeds of, of like the committee not functioning well and that one person could, after having signed off on this thing all the way [01:14:00] through.

[01:14:00] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Then killed is such a significant and, and useful thing. Uh, you know, that's, that sort of turned me off. I went to a couple more meetings, but I was already, I was already looking, looking elsewhere. 

[01:14:18] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. Yeah. I think that's, that, that's when I think I decided maybe subconsciously that I still went to the c plus plus [01:14:30] committee because now we're, at that point I had become responsible for this new implementation, clang of c plus plus, and I wanted to make that great, but I no longer felt like it was possible to make big improvements to c plus plus because the, the bar for change is so, there's so much work to make a significant improvement that would, it would really change the way people use the language.

[01:14:54] **DOUG GREGOR:** The bar was here, I knew how much effort it took to get there. Yeah. And I knew it could disappear. Yeah, right [01:15:00] on. On the whim of one person. Yeah. One, one bad email chain. 

[01:15:04] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:15:04] **DOUG GREGOR:** And it's hard to personally invest in something that can, that can go away. 

[01:15:08] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:15:09] **DOUG GREGOR:** Like that. 

[01:15:10] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. So, so it was only a few years, well I guess you must have made Clang Plus Plus really quickly because it was only a few years later that I asked you about coming to Apple and at that point Swift was already getting off the ground.

[01:15:26] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. We did the vast majority of clang c plus plus development [01:15:30] in under two years. I think we went from, it doesn't do any c plus plus to it compiles boost in 18 months. And that, that was the, that was the Benchmark Gold Standard Benchmark. Right. It was the gold standard benchmark. 

[01:15:42] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** It was complicated. It 

[01:15:43] **DOUG GREGOR:** was very excited to, you know, get up on stage and say, this compiles boost.

[01:15:47] **DOUG GREGOR:** It is real now. Yeah. Because that, that was, and in many ways still is the benchmark for. 

[01:15:53] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Boost, like stretches, stretches the language. Like that was [01:16:00] all, all those weird tricks that came from the weird machine. 

[01:16:03] **AMY GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[01:16:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Boost uses every single one of them and yeah. Only a faithful implementation of the standard would, would, uh, building.

[01:16:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Yeah. So, so yeah. I mean, I, I, I think we, we learned a huge amount from, from our work on c plus plus that we carried forward into Swift and I mm-hmm. You know, I, [01:16:30] you know, I'm super grateful for that experience. I think the, the experience of being on the committee was, was transformative in my life. And, and, uh, you know, uh, it was great to contribute to something that, that had such an impact and it contributed a lot back to me.

[01:16:49] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, you know, and then it's, it ran its course, I guess for me, tricky. 

[01:16:56] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah, I feel the same. I mean, you know, I've met lots of great people [01:17:00] through the Boost community. We built some amazing things that are now used everywhere, right? The, 

[01:17:05] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** yeah. 

[01:17:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** The things that we put into the c plus plus language are just the normal way that you program every day in, in SQLs Plus.

[01:17:14] **DOUG GREGOR:** And I see them all the time. Yep. I see Boost go by like, oh yeah, this depends on Boost. Of course it does. Why wouldn't it just be in the base system of every operating system out there? Right, right. Because it's, it's that widespread. Yeah. And we learned a lot. Go build the next [01:17:30] thing. 

[01:17:30] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yep. 

[01:17:30] **AMY GREGOR:** We came to support the entity of c plus plus that there had to be other groups trying to do the same thing.

[01:17:40] **AMY GREGOR:** Why Boost? 

[01:17:41] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Well that is really interesting. No other, uh, like I, I think we were a unique open source project in a lot of ways. But the idea that, that we existed to support some other project, the project of, of c plus plus. [01:18:00] That's, that's a completely unique thing. 

[01:18:03] **AMY GREGOR:** I think so. 

[01:18:04] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And I wonder if other languages have efforts like this.

[01:18:07] **AMY GREGOR:** Hmm. From a, from the community grew out, like it wasn't c plus plus saying, Hey, we need a separate subcommittee, you know? Right. To build a library. It was other people deciding that they would just say, Hey, we're gonna make something that can help. 

[01:18:20] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Yeah. No, it is a 

[01:18:22] **AMY GREGOR:** royalty. 

Its 

[01:18:23] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** a brilliant thing to notice.

[01:18:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. Um, yeah, I mean, it was, you know, Beman who, you know, he [01:18:30] was, he was, uh, had a important position in the committee, but he did it outside, outside the bounds of the committee, which is the only thing that would have been appropriate for, for that time. Right? Mm-hmm. Because the standard needed to be stable.

[01:18:46] **DOUG GREGOR:** Right. I don't know. It is an interesting confluence of like, you have this standard that needs to be stable, but you have people within that, that committee that want to go and [01:19:00] find the next great thing. Right, right. Right. They, they want, they want it to move forward, but a standards committee is not the way to do that.

[01:19:06] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. I wonder if partly this hasn't been replicated because most languages don't have the same kind of international standards committee of many, many people making decisions for them. Right. They, they tend to be lighter weight organizations, right? Yeah. That many of them use a process that's almost identical to the formal process for Boost that, that we did with peer review.

[01:19:27] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. At least Swift and Rust do. Yeah. The [01:19:30] Python process is very similar too. Yeah. It's, 

[01:19:32] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, 

[01:19:32] **DOUG GREGOR:** but, but they're smaller groups. 

[01:19:33] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** I remember when you asked me what we should do about the process for Swift, and I was like, boost did it. Let's, let's just do it again 

[01:19:41] **DOUG GREGOR:** from there. That's, the process is almost exactly the same.

[01:19:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** We have a review manager that runs the review. We have a formal review period where people do feedback and then we come back and, and make a decision on the final thing. Yeah. 

[01:19:52] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** But it did create a sort of a, you know, like sandbox isn't the right word. 'cause it diminishes the power of what Boost libraries were doing.[01:20:00] 

[01:20:00] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** That they weren't just a way to go play and explore an idea, but it was a way to go and prove a concept. And especially if we could get a client who wanted to make some implementation and they would pay us to do it, but it would be open source. And then eventually those ideas might make their way back into a c plus plus proposal because they had been proven, but they didn't, like, it wasn't like having to sell it into the standard, you know?

[01:20:24] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And so we were also fortunate, I think at that time there were clients who were interested [01:20:30] in customizing c plus plus for their uses that didn't have to match the standard. And they, they gave us a, that outlet, um, enough that we could make a really, you know, good 10 years. Go of it. 

[01:20:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** That's 

[01:20:44] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** great. Yeah. 

[01:20:45] **DOUG GREGOR:** I enjoyed working for you.

[01:20:46] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah, it was lovely. Side 

[01:20:49] **DOUG GREGOR:** gig 

[01:20:49] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** was research. It was super fun. 

[01:20:52] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. And it funded, funded going to committee meetings in lots of 

[01:20:56] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yes. 

[01:20:57] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Lots of interesting 

[01:20:58] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** places. Some, some great trips and [01:21:00] great people. And people were still, I mean, we saw Yako just last, this time last year we were at Bergen. Dave was at, uh, it was the anniversary of the language, uh, library at the university there.

[01:21:10] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** And it was, 

[01:21:11] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** yeah, the language languages group. I forget what it's 

[01:21:13] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** modern. It was like the ml 

[01:21:16] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** PBB something. 

[01:21:18] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Anyway. 

[01:21:19] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Well, Bergen B for Bergen. B Bergen Language Design Lab is what it was. Yes, 

[01:21:24] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** yes. 

[01:21:24] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** BLDL 15. So it was their 15th anniversary and uh, yeah. And Yako was there. [01:21:30] And BNA was there. Wow. And, um, yeah, and, and, uh, part of it was a panel.

[01:21:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and, uh, they, uh. Uh, one of the, one of the questions was for each of us on the panel, uh, is there a language design decision you made that you regret? And I was like, no, except guilty. And, and, and Duran goes, I agree [01:22:00] and no, but then you said it, it seemed like a really good idea at the time. 

[01:22:04] **DOUG GREGOR:** Mm-hmm. 

[01:22:05] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah.

[01:22:05] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Mm-hmm. Right? Yes. Um, and, and it did. And it did. And this is part of the problem with standardizing what's not existing practice, 

right? 

[01:22:12] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. 

[01:22:13] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yes. 

[01:22:13] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. It's, we, we weren't doing what, what the committee is supposed to do. Mm-hmm. And the committee, I think, strays from that still quite, quite often. Uh, yeah. So one of the great things, [01:22:30] uh, Chris was brilliant in, in setting the direction for Swift to be unstable for a few years.

[01:22:36] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** You know, so that we could, we could discover what was working and what wasn't. 

[01:22:41] **DOUG GREGOR:** You need that experimentation. 

[01:22:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:22:44] **DOUG GREGOR:** And yeah, I think, I think with Boost not being the driving entity for the c plus plus standard, now they're missing that. Mm-hmm. Right? They're, they're missing the, the experimentation to build up what is the best practice before we get in into the language.

[01:22:58] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Yep. 

[01:22:58] **DOUG GREGOR:** So it's a little bit more off the [01:23:00] cuff design. Yeah. Not as much trying it with real users. 

[01:23:03] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Right. People do implementations and they'll show an implementation, but it hasn't been out in the world like evolving due to the pressure that you get from actual users. Mm-hmm. Right? 

[01:23:14] **DOUG GREGOR:** Yeah. 

[01:23:14] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

[01:23:15] **DOUG GREGOR:** And they're the best users, are the best at finding the weak points of your design.

[01:23:21] **AMY GREGOR:** I asked you this in the car and you didn't know the answer. Where did the word boost or the name come from? You said that's a Dave question. 

[01:23:27] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, that's, that's a known story. [01:23:30] Uh, I, I wasn't there, but, but, uh. Uh, Beman and Robert Klarer were hanging out at the meeting right after standardization in, in France.

[01:23:43] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, um, and Beman had this idea of, you know, of what was was supposed to be. And, and there was like, let's come up with a name for it. And remember, you know, I said before, Java was super dominant [01:24:00] at this time and a lot of us, you know, kind of looked across at Java and thought, you know, that's a whole lot of hype for a whole lot of, not necessarily anything.

[01:24:10] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** And, and, um, and, but the, the thing was, you know, the idea was clearly you need to be named after a drink Oh, in order to, to, in order to be successful. And so, so somebody said, uh, well, it's gotta be booze. And [01:24:30] that turned into boost somehow. 

[01:24:31] **LUANNE ABRAHAMS:** Oh, that's so funny. 

[01:24:32] **DAVE ABRAHAMS:** Yeah. 

Yeah.
