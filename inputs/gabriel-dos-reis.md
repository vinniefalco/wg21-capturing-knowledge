## Transcript Start

[00:00:00] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Well, uh, I'm formally, uh, known as Gabriel, this race. Uh, my alias has always been GDR and, uh, close friends call me [00:00:30] Gabby and either of those Gabby, GDR, or Gabriel works for me. Um, I have known, uh, boost when it was originally created and, and it was created at the c plus trust standards meeting in, uh, 98 at Sophia Oli France.

[00:00:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** That was actually almost the first, uh, standards meeting I attended. And, uh, and Biman [00:01:00] was, uh, the second person I met, uh, the time first was Brn, who, um, directed me to. Beman because of the topics that I, I had and near the end of that meeting was when Boost was created as um, this kind of place entity that will help, um, C++ Programer boost their productivity and knowledge and, and the crafts of, of programming, the, the [00:01:30] origins of, of Boost Young student first time meeting, all these big names that I knew only through emails.

[00:01:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** 'cause that's, and used it. That's how conversation used to be at the time. Um, the, we just got the language. Language is fairly good. Uh, the library was anemic like you suggested earlier. And, um, the, the solutions for like, if you want to do network or [00:02:00] database and, and you, you know, these big libraries that people.

[00:02:03] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** You know, mention that they needed for actual production use, professional production use of C++. They were not part of this standard. They're still not part of this standard. So the, the, the question was at least from B'S perspective. Um, and, and a few of the smar is also a library guys, so is, um, uh, Robert Clara.

[00:02:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And the, the concerns were where would [00:02:30] C++ developers find solutions, uh, for these facilities that we, anybody needs some daily basis beyond toy programs? Right. And, uh, so at the time there were quite a few, um, commercial vendors and each with their own proprietary. Uh, solutions. One of the reasons why we want standard is that everybody has the same notation and has the [00:03:00] same understanding of, of the notations.

[00:03:02] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** That's why you have standard library, uh, or a standard in general. So, and in addition to that, we had this new programming paradigm coming in. Where would people go and find solutions and learn? So that was real concern for, for Beman. And, uh, I don't remember, I saw David Abrahams there, but I, I, I met, uh, bemans, uh, [00:03:30] and uh, and Robert Claire at, at that meeting.

[00:03:34] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and that's when they decided having a concession. Then they, well, we should fund this. And then eventually like, yeah, Bush, and that's how it came to be. And luck did, 

[00:03:44] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** did Clara go and you should call it Boost or how did that, what do you remember on that? 

[00:03:50] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I was only, uh, informed of the name, but I, I was not there exactly when he said, yeah, you should call it Boost, but, um, most likely that that's what it was.

[00:03:59] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But, [00:04:00] 'cause I knew Robert liked to have puns, right? That Robert is, uh, has, uh, you know, a good, you know, a Canadian has very good sense of humor and, uh, and, and I'm pretty sure the Boost Productivity boost came from Good Boost productivity. The way it was told I was not there when the, the name was like, was birthed, but I was told that was the conclusion they reached at, at the time.

[00:04:24] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And they informed the, the company at the time. Everybody's like, oh yes, we're going to have, uh, a place where we [00:04:30] go and we practice more generic programming and, and, and so forth. The Boost made a lot of good contributions and one of them I, I value a lot and, and respect a lot is having a formal review process and being implementation oriented.

[00:04:47] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Like when we are getting an idea, yes, we like the idea, but how do you make the idea work? Right? And, and I think that is like those criteria. And then do you make it work just [00:05:00] for the latest and greatest compilers or language version, or do you kind of, do you want to empathize with the people who are still on all the version of the compiler of a C++ compiler, but still have these needs that your library is going to, you know, to, to uh, to to, to satisfy And having this culture of people caring about needs.

[00:05:29] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** [00:05:30] At, at various stages, and they being very practical oriented. I think that is something that it did extremely well. The only other time that I see something coming close would be with CAN the Pearl, you know, uh, library Network. It, it, that's the only, that's the closest, um, analogy that, you know, that come to mind.

[00:05:53] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, if I were to tell a story about Boost was making a movie about [00:06:00] Boost, um, personally, I will start with the people because that's the foundation of everything. Every organization that I've seen, either within C++ community or outside, it is the people. The community follows. The leaders and leaders are the people.

[00:06:23] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and for me, uh, it will be, I would, uh. I'll go back to [00:06:30] Beman, the person he was and how passionate he was about C++. He was very, very passionate. And, um, the quality that he exemplify that drew like young people. I was, at the time, I was very young and my best friend at the time, Valentin Bunard was even younger.

[00:06:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, we were just drawn to this leadership style. Uh, like, um, [00:07:00] if you talk to Biman, you wouldn't know he was this gigantic, you know, force. He's just very, uh, modest, uh, soft spoken and always offers a, uh, perspective that invites people to reflect on what you're doing. Like he can come in very hard. All these things, then he'll listen very passionately.

[00:07:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But then ask very simple questions, and then that invites [00:07:30] reflection and then builds upon those ideas to move forward. He is very welcoming, especially of the, the, I would say, newbies. Novices. So that's where I'll start. Then. Um, I will move to how during the, between 98 and C++, uh, 11, um, the, the practice, the, the extensive libraries that Boost developed, actually shaped the, uh, the standard [00:08:00] library and component that came in and, and for it.

[00:08:06] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Well, so I, I mentioned, uh, C++ 11. Uh, by no means do I intend to, uh, imply that's the end of it. Of course, you know, we have C++ 26 soon. Um, and there have been a lot of, um, proposals that have been reviewed and implemented in Boost to get, um, field experience and have [00:08:30] been shipped up then and moved to, uh, to standard C++.

[00:08:33] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But the reason why I, I mentioned C++ 11 is because it is the, if, if you're looking at the essence of boost contribution, yes, I 0.2 C++ 11 because. It is what showed what was possible, what could be done. And anything that came out after that was just kind of scaling and, and just carrying over, um, the muscles that we [00:09:00] developed, uh, you know, by practicing Boost of course, um, you know, the, the C++ now, which is, you know, it used to be called Boost Con before he got my name.

[00:09:10] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, uh, to C++ now is also the place where you meet people. But again, from my perspective, the impact on C++ is 11 is the most. Exemplar significant one. Not the only one, but the most significant exemplar. Like [00:09:30] if, if you were to develop a new programming language and want to build, um, a community around it.

[00:09:36] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, I seriously, uh, you know, studied how things went with boost and, and so forth. And, uh, not to, uh, deliver too much the point, but to give you a concrete example. Uh, the, some of the key people who, who contributed to, uh, uh, to boost like the Abrahams who, uh, who co-founded Boost [00:10:00] with, uh, with Biman or, uh, Doug, Doug Gregor, uh, who contributed to the, uh, boost Graph Library back in the, the, the sms.

[00:10:09] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** They went on to, um, evolve design and evolve the, the library for Swift, for example. And if you look at the practices of, uh, now the Swift community, you'll see a lot of resemblance. Like clearly there is a, um, a lesson learned that was carried over there to develop a new community around the, and new [00:10:30] programming language.

[00:10:31] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Biman was just such a natural leader that everybody was drowned to him. And it would be very hard for me to give an exhaustive list of people, uh, who would, who helped him or were drowned to him. Um, but, you know, uh, you know. It, it's hard to talk about Bushcraft Library without talking about Jeremy s who, uh, was one of the main forces, uh, behind that of course, uh, have, [00:11:00] uh, Howard Hinan and, you know, I don't want to offend anybody by OMI them.

[00:11:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So right now those are the people that just come into mind that the other people are not important, but you mention. But yeah, uh, Jeremy, you know, you know, he, uh, he through a lot to Bushcraft Library, um, and to generate programming in general. Uh, but it's very active in, in the Bush community. Um, uh, that and over the [00:11:30] years.

[00:11:31] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, after plus six 11, um, you know, I've moved a little bit more into different communities, so I've kept less, um, daily touch with the community. But I do know, uh, people like, uh, uh, Jeff Galland who have taken on the torch to, to move forward. Um, the, um, uh, David Sekel who is also quite, [00:12:00] quite active. Um, but from my perspective, people in my interactions with B Man from 98, uh, became kind of the secondary wave of, uh, of the boost, uh, phenomenon.

[00:12:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Right. Uh, and, and no, I forgot. Wanted also to mention rubber cla. Was really very important. I think I may be wrong in this, 'cause this is a long time ago, but I think Robert, uh, Robert Clara was, uh, one of the guys who [00:12:30] suggested the name Boost, like in as boost, uh, productivity. I, I may be wrong. We'll have to double check on that story.

[00:12:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It's, uh, are there any antagonist to Beman? That's a hard question. Um, who would be antagonist to beman it? It's hard to answer because Beman doesn't work through antagonism. Some people, their leadership style is let [00:13:00] provoke some kind of drama. And then through the resolution of drama, we, we have a conclusion that was not the style of Beman.

[00:13:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Beman was more. There are a variety of thoughts. I want to hear them. I want people to discuss civilly and, and, and, and come to complete. So it is very hard to actually find anybody who would like, show up as say, oh yeah, I'm against Beman, or this, or that. So, uh, what was the purpose [00:13:30] and the goals of, of Boost?

[00:13:31] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, C++ 98 as it came out, had a very dynamic, um, library that we have. The containers, uh, even though there were some, um, companies were selling, uh, commercial products for containers of, that they all agreed to, to have, um, you know, that version is standard. But everybody understood at a time that the standard library was very small compared to this say, Java or, [00:14:00] you know, later c was coming and, or if you go to the scripting languages like Pearl, you know, it was clear to everybody that, um, uh, the standard library was very small, even as revolutionary as it was like Alex Pal's ideas about how to design, generate libraries and, and so forth.

[00:14:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So one question was, for all the other libraries, facilities that are not in the standard library, where would C++ programmers [00:14:30] find them? Could we just leave them to, oh, go and buy from store or something? What if it is not in that store, what to do? So it became clear. That not every library could be part of the standard library.

[00:14:46] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And if this standard has to take, um, every five years to release at a time, we were thinking five years to turn to three years later, but just to be, we were thinking every five years at, at a time, then it is too late to do anything, right? So [00:15:00] you need a practical solution to where can I find this facility, network, or these other container that didn't make it to a, uh, to the standard library.

[00:15:09] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So that was the first needs that, you know, needed to be, to be filled. Um, the second goal was that the STL, the Standard Library, it's not a template library, like as designed by Alex ov, came with a completely new way of thinking about [00:15:30] writing libraries, reusable components, and it's the old wave of generic programming and, and so forth.

[00:15:36] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So it was clear that for C++ as a language and C++ developers as a community to flourish, there ought to be a place where they go and learn from each other. And, and Boots was meant to provide that forum and, and in fact, that's really what it did. You know, just looking at the many, uh, components that came [00:16:00] from Boost Libraries that moved into.

[00:16:03] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, C++ 11, they, they, they were feeling real needs. They were tested. So people actually come in and they have those needs and tested what, what works. And the practice of generic programming that was new back in the, the ni late nineties was refined. And, and, and the, the knowledge disseminated so that more people could [00:16:30] understand the concept, how things meshed together and, and, and how to use them effectively.

[00:16:36] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So from my perspective, those two goals from Boost were really met. And, and the third was really just to provide a, uh, a place for people to, to, to build connections. I think that also succeeded, at least from my perspective, given, uh, how, uh, famous. Boost became, a [00:17:00] lot of people heard about Boost, even if they didn't themselves contribute, and, and they would go to, uh, C++ now just to meet the expert, just to meet the people who are making the libraries.

[00:17:11] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, um, as engineers, we like to measure things because when we ask, Hey, what, what did you accomplish? Then we can say, oh, look at that. We, we produced X megabytes of something. That's a concrete measurement when you say, oh, I built this community, and there are these many people happening and [00:17:30] become social and, and, and a criteria for measurement.

[00:17:33] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, kind of less numbered if I could say. Uh, so, you know, as engineers, we, we tend to just fall back to what we can measure right away. So, you know, as engineer we, you know, it's kind of this habit. We have to just fall back to what we can measure right away. Uh, it just, it doesn't mean that we have to dismiss that.

[00:17:57] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It's, it's, it's, um, it is important. [00:18:00] But when everything is said and done, what really remain is the connection. I, I, uh, I mentioned earlier, uh, Doug g Gregor and David Abrahams, and, and they have built followers that, and when they move on to the next adventure, which is, was to, uh, to build, uh, swift people followed them because they, it's not just that they, they, they built Boost.

[00:18:26] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It is that they built this community of people who believed in them [00:18:30] and, and believing in is beyond just having auto pointer or share pointer or unique pointer in something. It's, it's really beyond that. If Boost hasn't existed, what would, uh, C++ Miss Today if Boost hasn't existed? I really don't know what.

[00:18:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The C++ 11 library will look like that. Um, it, you know, it's, it, [00:19:00] it's, it's always tempting to replay and kind of remake the past. But, uh, um, I think if you look at RegX and, uh, many of the, uh, um, containers that made it in one form on the other renamed that made it a file system cr for example, um, that made it, uh, into the standard library.

[00:19:23] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I don't know. Because what happens is when you have a community who believes in a goal, [00:19:30] it, it, that has a force in itself like to build some kind of energy inertia that move things forward, right? But when you leave it to individuals like, okay, hey, go and build a a fire system library. Nobody's going to pay you.

[00:19:46] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Well, you're going to do that in addition to your daytime job. And guess what? Usually daytime job will have priority because you, you know, that's what, what pays. Uh, but when you have a community, have [00:20:00] a lot of people with passion about something, then the sense of belonging somehow, you know, act on people to contribute even if that's going to take on a little bit from some other priorities that they have, right?

[00:20:16] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So you have a, you know, gazillions of people each contributing a little bit of bit and that make a big, you know, um, river as opposed to just having individual, each individual going, oh, I'm going to [00:20:30] build that file system thing. Guess what? Daytime, like real life will, will come in and, and we'll be distracted, right?

[00:20:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So I don't know what it will look like. All I know is what we have and the reason why we have it, which is that we have that community. Each body, uh, everybody, uh, contributing they little they could. And then we have a fantastic leader that kept the, uh, the community, uh, together and moving forward. I was born, uh, in [00:21:00] Togo, west Africa, um, a few decades ago.

[00:21:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, um, I, the first time I, I touched a computer was when I was 18. I moved to France. Um, I was a student in some. Uh, French educational system on math and, and so forth. And there is no way you can, at the time, there was no way you could, uh, survive the French education without, uh, learning how to program in [00:21:30] Pascal.

[00:21:30] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then later, I know Camel and, and, and so forth. So learn, I learned Pascal in 92, and that was the first time I actually taught a computer. Uh, and very quickly I got fascinated with programming. Um, by 95 I moved to, um, to Paris, to the Al Superior to Kaon. I was a, a student in the math department and for some reason I, uh, I will regularly skip the algebra class because I was so [00:22:00] fascinated with C++ and, um.

[00:22:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** My very first contribution to C++ was, uh, the implementation of the Valerie class, or marginally numeric components of the standard back in 98 to, um, GCC. So by 97, based on some internship I did that, uh, a French, uh, research institute. I built the Valerie Library, [00:22:30] so I gave it to, uh, you know, 90 summer, 97 was when we had a huge fork, I know EGCS or eggs as we, we call it at the time of, of GCC.

[00:22:42] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then NUS was kind of the main provider of resources to, to work on, on eggs at the time. So I gave my implementation of Valerie to nus and, and then it told me, well, we don't have anybody to, uh. Uh, to maintain it. Would you like to be maintained? I said, oh, sure. [00:23:00] I was a student at the time, so had a lot of free time on my hands.

[00:23:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, and, uh, it was during the, uh, implementation of Vale rate that I discovered bunch of, uh, inconsistencies and I wanted them fixed. At that point, I was told that the only way I could have my voice heard was if I joined the C++ committee through my national body, which at the, at the time was Afna, the French, uh, national group.

[00:23:28] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So I joined Afna, [00:23:30] uh, in 97, September 97. And, uh, very quickly, you know, they got me into WG 21 and that's how I became members of W 21. And I got my stuff resolved through the, uh, through, through the committee. Um, so I started working on the standard library. For GCC, uh, in summer, uh, 97, and I became more and more frustrated with, uh, uh, GCC support for template.

[00:23:59] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I thought it would [00:24:00] just be, it's a software, it's a bug and fix it. And oh boy, I was, uh, very wrong. It's official kind of software. So, um, I started programming in C++ in 95, and that was most beginning it, it was, uh, I was taking a class on programming with C++. So 95, remember that's when we got almost a year before, you know, after we got Netscape and all the, uh, web and that sort of stuff.

[00:24:29] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** [00:24:30] Um, and, uh. I was also a student in the math department at the Al Superior de Cashon. So I have to say something a little bit about that school. So it's a school new, in a very weird setup in the French uh, system where essentially as a student you kind of paid your, uh, government employee and you're paid to do something useful.

[00:24:53] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So every year they check what have you done, what diploma you get, and otherwise there was no check on whatever it was. [00:25:00] I was taking September 95, I was taking a class on programming with C++, and the first class was, uh, we were asked to write a linked list of in. I'm like, oh, come on. That was not very, uh.

[00:25:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, entertaining for me, and I almost dropped that class. What I did was I went on, on the web, by the time we didn't have Google and we had Alta Vista, uh, as the search engine, [00:25:30] so it was a c plus tutorial. I wanted something more formal, so I was going through links and then I clicked on one link that said, oh, um, there's a few things.

[00:25:41] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And it started saying an object is a sequence of buy with some other properties. Now I see an apprentice mathematician that spoke to me. That was real. It was formal. It was not linked, linked of into No, no. It was like, it was telling me what an object was, how an object, you know, started life. [00:26:00] Ended a life and Okay.

[00:26:01] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And I also, um, you know, happy with this thing that I just hit the, uh, the print button. Hm. And that was my first mistake because came out of the printer about seven pages of, of text. They were kind of obscure, but at least they, this spoke to my mind as a mathematician. Like that is very form of different from the other halo word or length list, things of things.

[00:26:27] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So I spent about, um, [00:26:30] a month in my dorm room just pouring over this text and was only later that I realized that was the, what we called at the time, CD two, with the second version of the committee draft of the C++ standard specification. I didn't know when I. Hit prayed. It was way after. So the way I learned C++ was originated through the standard draft, and then [00:27:00] eventually I got, uh, beyond's book on design and evolution of, of C++.

[00:27:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, um, what about me? So I, I am a mathematician who likes to see things. My, uh, formal training is in geometry, like you have shapes and, and, and that sort of thing. So, uh, the idea that I could use the computer program. To, to express these mathematical entities and play with them. That was the thing that draws [00:27:30] me really into, into this thing.

[00:27:32] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And like I was saying, my first primary language was Pascal, and the first library that I wrote was Linear Algebra, multiplying Metrices, and doing linear algebra. So now that I got this language that was very powerful, I could build more abstractions than just matrices. I was, oh yeah, it was a completely different thing.

[00:27:50] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So from my perspective, it was just the ability to illustrate, um, abstract concepts and visualizing them either [00:28:00] graphically or just like, you know, true the effects on some other, uh, measurement is what draw me to, to the language. Alright. So what you, at the time, at the time I was also 95, I started being introduced to, um, uh, OCaml sort scheme and OCaml.

[00:28:16] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** They didn't have the same. Impact on my brain as c plus plastic 96. I read the chapters on, um, on pointer to members. And from my perspective, again, I [00:28:30] say a, a apprentice mathematician, it felt like the algebra, the, the operations, the composition of, uh, uh, of point tumor members was missing or was just like a, is that one thing you can reference and that's it.

[00:28:45] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But usually you, you, you, you want element and way to combine them. And I felt like the combination was missing. And Danny had, um, a, I'm talking about something I happened in 96 was the first time actually I had contact with him electronically. Uh, [00:29:00] so I sent him a, uh, an email saying, oh, uh, dear or no, I just read dear.

[00:29:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Book, you know, chapter on pointer to members. You talk about this thing, but I think from the logic perspective, I don't believe that your conclusion follows. So, you know, I would like to know, is there any other work being done to complete, like, to, to have the, uh, the composition, the full algebra? So I sent, got the mail a couple of hours later.[00:29:30] 

[00:29:30] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I got a very, I got a response back from bni, very polite and, uh, and, uh, typical BNI style. He, uh, he did acknowledge, uh, my concern, but also proceeded to explain that from practical perspective it was important to have some other considerations. So it is not. Sufficient to be logically correct, you also have to be practically useful.

[00:29:55] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And that his decisions on not completing, pursuing whatever was being [00:30:00] proposed for pointer to members at the time was from practical consideration perspective. I do not remember the exact words that he said, but those were the, uh, a sense of what, what he said. And, and from there on, most of our interactions were, uh, via emails.

[00:30:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then in 98 when that the meeting were boost was, uh, was, was created, I mentioned earlier, um, uh, I met him and say, Hey, I have, I have been. [00:30:30] Building this library, Valerie and I have these problem that I want to get fixed, and the first thing he did was to point me to, um, uh, Beman. So that's how Beman was the second person I met at the, uh, at the meeting.

[00:30:43] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And also to Doug, bro, who at the time was from student, I think. And it also interested in numeric, uh, library. What was that name again? Dag. Dag Broker. Okay. Um, and then over the years it became clear that my [00:31:00] focus has shifted from just library to generic programming. And why generic programming? That again, goes back to my background as a mathematician.

[00:31:08] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** When you're talking about vector space, you have like, everything is generic, so all the things that I wanted to visualize or play with and on the computer, they all came with a generic component. You have mattresses, you can have just floating point intes or you can have big nus and they, so it, they're very generic in, in their characters.

[00:31:28] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um. [00:31:30] And I became less and less satisfied with the support for generic programming in C++. So I started coming up with ideas to, to solve that problem. The problem was constrained. How do I express upfront the set of properties that I'm requiring for a generic program, uh, a generic algorithm to work.

[00:31:53] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, um, I had a first attempt in 2001 at the A CCU conference. I quickly [00:32:00] on that, the second one. Which was the most consequential was in 2002, uh, where I gave a talk. The title was Generate Programming in Next Level, and BNI TRO attended that talk along with James Copeland. And, um, after that talk, uh, B-A-B-M-Z, we, we should collaborate.

[00:32:22] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** You know, I have done some of these things you talk about, but I didn't have these notation and these other ideas. And 2002 was when we [00:32:30] started collaborating. And, um, summer 2003, I invited him for a few weeks at, uh, um, I was a postdoc at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control in Rio Fiance Police, the very first place we met, first time in 98, so, uh, 2003, five years later he came.

[00:32:54] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And that was when. We brought a series of papers, three papers [00:33:00] were, I would say, the, at the foundation of concept, what we call concept support in the language. Um, the fourth paper was, uh, on, uh, template aliases. And the fifth, uh, paper was on, uh, Conex. So these days everybody talks a lot about Conex sphere.

[00:33:19] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** We are going to have static reflection, c plus C++, uh, 26, which is essentially compar computation. But the, the seeds, the, [00:33:30] the, the, the, the primary support for compar computation in C++, the, the very first paper, I wrote it back there in, in, in, uh, summer thousand three, uh, when Vienna was visiting.

[00:33:43] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, he is always open to ideas, even the stupidest one, like, you know, there is no stupid idea. Like he would listen and if the idea is truly, truly stupid, he will walk through, through the fact so that you can come to the [00:34:00] conclusion yourself. Right. He will not shut you down. No, he didn't. Um, so after the, that summer 2003, he offered a postdoc, you know, for me to join him at Texas c and m.

[00:34:13] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So I moved there. So we worked more closely, like day on daily basis, literally on daily basis, sometimes even including on weekends. Um, it, the way it worked was there was never, um, so [00:34:30] I've seen some other places usually have the, the big buba and then the apprentice. That was not the way that BNI set up the collaboration environment.

[00:34:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It was like peer. And we were collaborating as opposed to, um, I'm the big boy. And then you just, yeah. So that environment of collaboration made it simple, uh, for both of us to bounce half bake ideas and, um, [00:35:00] when someone making assertions like, well, how is that possible? So it become, we're asking for, can you walk me through some logical deduction?

[00:35:08] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Or is it just a, some empirical fact that you observed? And we take that into account. But it was a, a refreshing, um, candor that made it possible to just like work bluntly without fear of, uh, um, you know, [00:35:30] so he, he, he was my boss, right? Like when I went there, he, uh, you know, I was postdoc with him. So some sense he was my boss, but I never felt like he was my boss.

[00:35:39] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** He also made me feel he was a collaborator, right? So when he had an idea, I can shoot it down, I can, or I can firm it up similarly, when I had an idea and I bounce it off and, you know, he will shoot it down or he'll raise it up and, and never a worry about, [00:36:00] oh, who is going to get credit? Nah, it has never been like that.

[00:36:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, yeah, never, ever. 

[00:36:06] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** He's, he's a guy who's more into, uh, the success of the code than his reputation. 

[00:36:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Beyond did not worry about whether people thought, uh, what his reputation was. He was concerned primarily about how to make the C++ community successful. So to give you a, um, an an example. [00:36:30] Um, so when, when I.

[00:36:32] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Went to Texas to, to work more closely with him. So, thousand three, that's also, you'll see it's the period where some other competing languages are coming around. They're, you know, object oriented, this object oriented that, and his concern was really about how do I make sure so I can see some good ideas in those languages, but.

[00:36:57] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The, the domains of applications are not [00:37:00] necessarily exactly the same as C++. So c plus is still needed for these other, uh, problems, infrastructure, and how do I make sure that the C++ community can thrive? So that was his main, um, uh, concern. And most of what he did, like when I was there with him between 2003 and 2013, has always been how do I make sure that the community thrives?

[00:37:29] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** [00:37:30] So I heard him complain a lot about the lack of a place where people will go. So lack of conferences. So I heard him complain a river to, to Herb for example, and eventually Herb, uh, started going native, which became CB PK. Right? Um, so it has always been. How to help the community as opposed to, I'm beyond tro.

[00:37:53] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I need to be recognized as such. Bian Tro is the creator and the original, uh, [00:38:00] implementer of the C++ programming language. He, uh, he got his, uh, PhD at, uh, Cambridge UK and then moved to, uh, uh, bell Labs and has worked there for more than 25 years. I forgot the exact number, but for a long period of time.

[00:38:16] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And C++ was born there, you know, in the Unix room. He was there with the Unix people. And, uh, you, if any of you have ever read some his, some of his writings, he will frequently [00:38:30] mention or, or acknowledge the influence of Brian Cunningham. So Brian Cunningham of K and RC. The K, yeah. So, um, he. He, the original, the, the, the origin of C++ really goes back to, um, his work as a student PhD.

[00:38:52] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then when he went to Bell Labs to, to do work there, um, most of the principles [00:39:00] came from there. And, and then he got, uh, pretty good, I would say, mentors and, uh, environment to, to, to work and only worry about the benefits of, uh, programmers. The C++ programming language these days is known by being defined by, uh, a, a group, a committee called WG 21, which has a longer name like I-S-O-I-E-C, JTC one, SC 22 WG 21.

[00:39:29] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** There you [00:39:30] go. The full thing. Uh, but it is an ISO committee that. Uh, contain, um, uh, international representations, um, and, uh, charged with defining a, the C++ standard. So C++ is not owned by any one company, unlike some of the languages, the realm, it's, it's just by that committee. And it was created, um, uh, end of 89 or [00:40:00] early, uh, nineties at the.

[00:40:03] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Requests of HP and, and other, um, companies who walk into, uh, B a's office say BA, you need to have an ISO standard and say, oh no, why? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you need to, and then they proceed to explain why, you know, they, they had interest in using C++, but if it was owned by just one company, it will be a risk for others to depend on it.

[00:40:28] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And that's how [00:40:30] we got to have this ISO standard committee. And, you know, the whole thing is owned by this, this committee. 

[00:40:38] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Yeah. What's I-S-O-I-S-O 

[00:40:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** is an organization, it is not an acronym, it's just the name. It's, uh, it's an organization for international standards. But again, this is not the, the acronym, uh.

[00:40:54] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** 98, the meeting, uh, the I standard W 21 meeting in tlo, [00:41:00] the first meeting Sophia 98. So for me, it was, as a student, it was, uh, very cheap to attend because all I needed to do was to take a flight from, uh, Paris, uh, Ali, and, and go to, uh, to n um, at then studio for a week. That was the extent of expense that I needed to, to do.

[00:41:20] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It was very simple, but again, uh, I was, uh, some committee members at the time would [00:41:30] refer to me as the baby on the committee, although I dispute that because I was not a baby. The baby was my other friend who was younger than me. But the, the point was that we were very young students, uh, with. Strong interest in C++ and what you can do, not just the language as a, um, arts, but as a tool, what you can build with it.

[00:41:53] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and for me it was, uh, scientific computation, uh, then coming in there and how coming, 

[00:41:59] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** [00:42:00] so coming in where, so what do we see? Help, help me understand where we're 

[00:42:03] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** at here. So at Sophia Anti Police, so, uh, the, the meeting was held, uh, on the, uh, in, on the premises of, uh, INRIA Sophia Antipolis. So Inria is the, uh, French national, uh, institute in research and computer science and uh, and control.

[00:42:23] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And so this was in the spring of 98. So sky, beautiful. [00:42:30] Okay. Beautiful sky. And this is France. So food is also non-negotiable. So. I think many of committee members who attended that meeting, including bna, when they talk about the 98th meeting, they will, first thing they'll do is reference the food. And the wine.

[00:42:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So I think we, we, we accomplished that. And, and just to, to make sure, like, uh, 10 years later in 2008, [00:43:00] BNA and I, while we were at Texas a and m, we actually organized, uh, the another standards meeting at the same place. And because people have been asking for, Hey, when would you get to the next, uh, standards meeting?

[00:43:12] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, and, and Sophia. So it just, the, the place, the physical place and the landscapes is very beautiful. It was, we, we know the committee had a, a, a field trip to, as, so as is this village in, in the south of France. And, and notorious for, uh, some philosophers like Nietzsche, who [00:43:30] spent some time there. Right. So it, it just, it was a very beautiful time.

[00:43:35] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The committee didn't have to do a lot of work at that specific meeting because we just put out the, the, the, the, the final draft approved by the committee. So we couldn't. Do anything to change the draft or talk technical stuff about it. So we did have a lot of concerns from some other people. So for example, the Japanese, um, delegation came with, [00:44:00] uh.

[00:44:00] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** They would rather have embedded C++. At the time, it was this thing where you have to use a small subset of cpl, so you can't use templates, you can't use name search because people were afraid and the maturity of implementation was just letting people not being afraid. So we heard those concerns, but the general feeling was, oh, we just got this thing out for the first time.

[00:44:23] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Let's get to know each other. Right. That, that it was really very, uh, informal. Now, we had [00:44:30] field trip to ez, I think it was a Friday afternoon. We had another, uh, trip to uh, uh, we were supposed to go to the Caino, uh, in Monaco. So Monaco is not very far from, uh, from Sophia Antipolis. And eventually, not everybody got into the Kainos, but all I knew was that some of us.

[00:44:48] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Could not get into the ca casino because we were not age appropriate. We did do a lot of tourism in, in the, the town of, of Monaco, so it was [00:45:00] fairly celebratory, but also, you know, talk shop a little bit. The celebration was really about having the first ever standard for C++, because up until then C++ was defined to some degree by, uh, what we call the C++ arm.

[00:45:20] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The C++ annotated annotated reference manual, which BNA wrote back in a, in 80, 89 or 90, which was the basis [00:45:30] for the standards documents later. So just the ability of having, I think it was 22, um, countries all voting yes on the first standard. That was just like, oh, wow. And the reason why it was so, oh wow.

[00:45:49] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Was just to, to, to set some context. CD two and I, I mentioned earlier that I launched C++ from CD two. So there was a CD one before the CD one [00:46:00] was issued late, um, 93 long before I got in involved. And people thought that would be the actual C++ standard. And then Alexan came with the STL and which was adopted.

[00:46:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And that completely changed people's perspective. So we got a new version of the, uh, of, of the draft. So some people were kind of nervous, like, oh, we were supposed to be done by [00:46:30] 95. Now this is adding more like work that we need to do. Will we be able to finish? So just being able to actually say, yes, we are done.

[00:46:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And having the 22 countries all saying, yes, this is the thing we want to have was a. It was cause for real celebration. So, so the vote was in the room, the vote was in the, uh, the, the, the national bodies sending comments to ISO and then there was just, yeah, by the time we arrived at the meeting, it [00:47:00] was clear through the informal grapevines, through informal communication that every country was on board.

[00:47:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and the reason for that was, uh, a few months before that at a Morristown meeting in uk, uh, there was a huge kind of drama where, um, there was one, uh, national body who said we needed to have some form of, uh, ownership auto pointer. So that's how we got auto pointer. And at the time, people didn't really know [00:47:30] how to make it work.

[00:47:30] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then eventually they locked a couple of, uh, experts in the room and asked them to come up with a solution. And, and then that one national body was. Um, threatening to vote no if we didn't make auto pointer work. So that was, uh, I think November 90, 97. And in between November 97 and um, bar to April 98, the moods turned like we were able to, [00:48:00] uh, solve that concern from that national body, very important national body.

[00:48:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then everybody, so informally when you ask everybody, oh yeah, yeah, we are going to approve. So we knew at that meeting, even though the vote was not formal, that everybody, all the countries involved. We're going to say yes, even if some of the countries were having some concerns, like the ones who came with, uh, the embedded C++ objection, they also voted yes.

[00:48:26] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** What I know of the origin was the idea of being discussed, [00:48:30] like need a place to have, um, standard, more standard library facilities. So Biman at the time was the library working group chair. So at the time we only, we only had three groups. We had, uh, the evolution call extension of rename, evolution, working group, core working group, and library working group.

[00:48:48] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Today we have four groups, like the library working group was split into two, like library evolution and then library working group at the time was just one group and Beman was the chair of it, [00:49:00] and he recognized the need. For having something on the side while ISU processes was going on and, and having a community.

[00:49:10] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So he was discussing the ideas informally. And I remember my, uh, friend, uh, you know, Valentina, the, the other French I was there with. Um, and both of us were students very much into libraries and that sort of stuff. So, uh, we both sign up, not as a founder, but just as [00:49:30] early members of, of Boost. And Valentine was a lot more active than I was because I got distracted by GCC, um, the name, I didn't have any input in it.

[00:49:43] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I knew Robert, uh, Robert Clara, um, dim, I forgot to mention him earlier. Dim was very, very instrumental in the early days of, uh, of Post. 

[00:49:56] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Okay. So can you tell us a little bit about each of those people? Who's Robert Cla. [00:50:00] 

[00:50:01] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Robert, uh, was a representative of IBM at the time, and he was also the ISO secretary for WG 21.

[00:50:09] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So he will take minutes of, you know, formal minutes of all discussions that we had usually on, uh, on Sundays and on the last days where we have votes and, and so forth. But the, the part that was most relevant to boost was his, um, his sense of design and, uh, experience in [00:50:30] building libraries and, and to some degree, uh, Roberts is, is also very much interested in building communities and he has this sense of taking a step back.

[00:50:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I don't know why that they named him as a secretary or not, but he has this ability of taking a step back, looking at conversations, going on and producing a synthesis. Like from, you know, really wonderful, uh, synthesizer. So he was very, very good at that. And, and I think he was the one who just said, oh yeah, I went to boost, like, [00:51:00] boost the, so 98 communication technologies.

[00:51:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So at, at the time, what we had in the CPL plus plus community was we had, uh, the news net. So you have comp length C++ moderator, that is where most of the conversation's going. Or you have comp standard C++, that is where if you're compala riders or you, you're kind of very particular about a certain sentence in the, in the [00:51:30] standard.

[00:51:30] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** That's where you go and, and argue. But if you're interested in the general use, like professional use of C++, you go to comp lung C++ moderated. And, and Robert Clara was one of the moderators. Uh, so. The, we knew near the end of the, uh, meeting in police that, Hey, we're going to have this organization.

[00:51:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then it was announced, and then you had a way to go and, and subscribe to the mailing list. So mailing list. So using it, that is how, you know, we communicated at the [00:52:00] time, there was no instant messaging thing that we have. I mean, IRC doesn't count. Perfect. Um, and so yeah, it was announced and, and for many of us, yeah, boost is the thing, right?

[00:52:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It, it's, it's the unique place that you go, uh, you learn or, uh, if you're in the ideation phase, you can go and, and spit, you know, uh. [00:52:30] Kind of just express your ideas and see if there is a, an uptake, and then have like-minded people help you build, uh, the, uh, the products. And then as the community started growing and it became clear that they needed to have a more formal review process and how it to be done, who is the owners and, and so forth.

[00:52:48] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But it was set up in a way to invite, as opposed to having some kind of rigid bureaucracy that would intimidate people all away. And it was really like the entry level was very [00:53:00] low to get people in there. And again, at the time, we were more worried about having people than having the wrong people. So Policying wasn't a, a concern.

[00:53:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And again, bi man's view is start with inclusion. And then he always believed in the goods of people. So you, you can, I won't say educate, but you can bring someone from. Being super aggressive to being [00:53:30] more inclusive of ideas, even if they're not theirs. Well, I should start with, uh, a disclosure, which is that these days I read less.

[00:53:39] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I, I, I still read, receive boost messages on my private, uh, inbox, but I read them less than I used to do, um, back in, in late nineties. And, uh, so I may not be able to have a firsthand, um, [00:54:00] summary of how the communication has become. I've only heard and, and seen some steps taken. So usually when these steps are taken, something bad is happening.

[00:54:13] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Right now, the things that I've witnessed and, and lived back in the early days when Boost was, was created. So we all knew that. You always have bad people. Like, like I mentioned earlier, uh, we, you know, use [00:54:30] that use comp lung C++ moderated, so that group was moderated. So we knew that we'll have people who come in and be disruptive, right?

[00:54:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So it wasn't like, it was not a, a non concept, but the way b set it up was if you set the right example, if you set the right atmosphere, that in itself will kind of move people to behave properly, right? 'cause [00:55:00] usually people tend to, if they see some kind of policing and thing, that they will act against the, you know, the policing and, and, and that sort of, kind of working around it and, and so forth.

[00:55:09] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So he really wanted, uh, an inclusive environment, so he will set the tone and people around him followed him in that step. So for the most part, that has worked, like when I followed all the conversation until. Like I joined Microsoft, um, has been extremely positive [00:55:30] because that's just the way Biman wants the place to be run, right?

[00:55:33] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Even when there are contentious, like if you put bright people together, eventually you'll have clash of ideas. Ideas, right? So people become passionate about the ideas, but they still remain ideas. And his view is that as long as we are only at the ideas, we can work it through, we can, we, we can disagree on ideas without being disagreeable, right?

[00:55:58] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** That's, I've heard [00:56:00] him say that phrase quite many times, like, you know, in, in person. Um, so that's what happens. You know, when while he was, while he was running the, uh, the, the project, I know that recently there have been a lot of, um. Contentions in, in the, in the boost communities and leading some to kind of wanting to have a fork and, and and so forth, which kind of chare [00:56:30] me to some degree.

[00:56:32] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, so is there a, a single cause for this? Is it just not been there or is it just the atmosphere around, you know, now social media and, you know, being continually online? What is that, that, to our brain, when we are having conversations, it's, it's hard to tell, but, uh, it, I wouldn't discount the, the timing, what's going [00:57:00] on in the walls when these things happen.

[00:57:01] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Where we all became kind of locked down mode, for example, where we, our interactions just became through the keyboards and, and. Uh, not being able to go out and connect with that other person and acknowledge the humanity in the other person that didn't, that ceased to become a, a practice on, on, on daily basis.

[00:57:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and, and good chunk of that. And, uh, social media [00:57:30] in itself became a very sensationalist, like when you, when you go on tutor, it's most of the time it sounds like, oh, you know, it's not called tutor anymore, it's called something else. Um, it, it sounds like it's continual drama. You get points and likes for being nasty or zingers, but rarely is that productive.

[00:57:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** From, from 98 through 2005, I was more active in [00:58:00] reading, uh, uh, boost, uh, mailing list and, and following the reviews. And I did not actively ask. Participate as much as I would like, because I was already involved in GCC, which is kind daytime job. And then doing, trying to do my PhD work, sorry, uh, postdoc work and, and so forth.

[00:58:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, but I will, like, every single day our daily reads all the conversations and reviews as going on. So I actually liked the way it was conducted. Uh, you know, the, [00:58:30] the feedback were always in terms of how to improve and cover more usage. Right. That, that was the, the way it was done. Yeah. I witnessed those, you know, uh, in person as breeding them and, and so forth.

[00:58:44] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And I've been less active in reading boosts communications after I joined Microsoft, partly because the, the workloads as quadruple. If, if I would, uh, if I would name [00:59:00] one that I think. Uh, it was really, really game changer. It was actually the, uh, technical specification that, uh, BMAN oversaw. It's the file system, um, technical.

[00:59:12] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So at the time we called them, uh, technical reports, crs, but BAN was really the one who pushed, uh, for it. And, and so from my perspective, that is, that is the most significant, impactful, um, abstraction that [00:59:30] came out of Boost. And I could go and explaining why. Yeah, I'm glad. So, C++ is supposed to be a cross platform.

[00:59:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, programming language, can use it on Windows, can use it on Unix, Linux, and all embedded systems. And yet it did not provide up until 2017 a, um, a mechanism, a cross-platform notation for doing a very basic things like. Go look at [01:00:00] that directory. Giving the listing of the files, giving the path and a com manipulation of the path, the file system, it always left it to, oh, each implementation, each platform will have its own thing.

[01:00:11] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** What that did was it just, it encourage people to write non portable if, if theft, uh, code were not always tested to the same degree and it somebody is just like, why do we even [01:00:30] have a standard for, right? And now when you look at file system, effectively we've got windows on min or unique systems or POS in general.

[01:00:39] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It can take a lot of variations. So being able to come with a unique abstraction that has an implementation that come very fast, that provides, uh, facilities for all C++ programmers to use. I think that was. From my perspective, it is more impactful than having, let's say, another implementation of Share [01:01:00] pointers, C++ seven.

[01:01:02] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, 11, 14, 17 saw quite a lot of libraries that were originally developed in Boost to gain experience, moved to the standard. And I think that was a good thing. 'cause part of the purpose of Boost was to provide existing experience and provide libraries that are used by a lot of people. And if some of those are so [01:01:30] widely used that, you know, the better way of having them is to have the standard that is the way to migrate them.

[01:01:36] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I will say that at the same time, some people like, I can't own name, but some people felt like, um, boost was unfairly dominating the library process were. Uh, you can only get your stuff into the standard, only if it's boost, which I don't think is fair. [01:02:00] But you can also do the math and then see, oh yeah, I can see they have some point there.

[01:02:05] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Right. Uh, so that sentiment was expressed quite, uh, a few times, you know, either in formal meeting or you know, in corridor conversations or lunch conversation, people will say something about, well, yeah, another Boost Library is like, that's a way of saying, oh, of course it's Country Boost Library. Uh, so some 

[01:02:26] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Boost Boost, uh, boost Haters.[01:02:30] 

[01:02:30] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, I would say some people were annoyed. I wouldn't necessarily hate it, but they were just annoyed that, oh. So the thing, the, the perception was that Boost established such a mind share that the minute you say this thing was implementing Boost, we were like, oh yeah, okay, good, good, good, good. No, come in.

[01:02:52] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Right? Yeah. It was kind of, uh, so some people were annoyed at, at that kind of perception. But again, it is about a mind share. [01:03:00] Is is the reputation well deserved? I think that is the, the first question. And the second is, okay, is the product in front of us, the library component in front of us, does it, does it serve the community at large?

[01:03:15] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And does it have the reputation of what we'll expect from, from boost? Because from engineering perspective, biman really want, want people to like maintain a high standard, right? Like, here's the CCO that you want in your company. [01:03:30] So. So C++ 11, uh, was, is the game changer, was the game changer compared to C++ O three or 98.

[01:03:42] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So C++ O three is just a, a bug fixes over, uh, C++ 98. So what really are in C++ 11 that make us say it was a game changer? So the first thing that I'll mention is [01:04:00] the formalization of move semantics. So Howard at Hinan, another great library designer, uh, really set out to solve the ownership problem.

[01:04:11] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So C++ basic, you know, programming technique, REI, resource acquisition is initialization. So. In C++ 98, we only had the notion of copying. We didn't have the notion of moving, or if you wanted to move, then you have to play the tricks that was [01:04:30] played for auto pointer, which we all agreed was disgusting and we didn't want people to like, uh, copy.

[01:04:38] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, so Howard set out to have a language support. For move semantics. Let's say I open the file in, in, in the function and I want to return the open handle to, to whoever called me and then attach it to this kind of resource management thing perspective. In Simplus source [01:05:00] 98, you couldn't do that because they only way will return something that is using a copy constructor, which will mean no.

[01:05:05] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Well, if you're copying and this is one unique resource, then you need to close and then reopen the other side. It's just bad, right? It's not good. Uh, resource management. So move Symantec just saying, oh, I'm holding this thing. We can only be one person holding at a time, and I'm done with what I need to do Now.

[01:05:22] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I'm getting out of here. I'm transferring ownership to you. So that was the move semantic that has a, a built-in language support and [01:05:30] then library features that came out of it. So that is in it itself, is a game changer. It removes many of the, uh, perceived, um, inefficiencies copy that was in C++, uh, 98.

[01:05:45] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So that was the first thing. The second thing, uh, is that I worked with BA to introduce this notion of compile time computation. So this was the first time that we didn't need to use macros. We could [01:06:00] just write a normal function with some squiggle saying it's concept expert that need to follow some rules and then ask the compiler to invoke that function while it is compiling the code in, in a specific context.

[01:06:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So it opened up a new way that we didn't have before. For programming with C++ and combined with template argument, deductions and non-type template and so forth, it's completely new ways of, uh, of, of doing things. [01:06:30] Um, then we had, uh, third, we had a memory model. So in C++ 98, we all knew we have p thread and we can do concurrency thread and all that kind of stuff.

[01:06:41] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But the, the memory model of the language C or C++, were not up to snuff with this sort of concurrency that was coming. So C++ 11 was the first. Of the sea family to have a formalized [01:07:00] definition of what it means to have threads and, and concurrency and, and so forth. And, and when you have, you know, can talk about, uh, data race and, and what happens and, and so forth.

[01:07:11] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So that of course, was really, really important because now it means if I'm doing concurrency on Windows or on Linux, I don't need to have pit thread or create thread on, on, on Windows. I can just use one single facility and, and opens, uh, uh, portability. And then of [01:07:30] course on the library side, we have a lot more, um, uh, facilities.

[01:07:34] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So it was really like just being able to have the concurrency and the ownership. And then of course, facilities like Lambda that were invented by, uh, my colleague, uh, Yaku Javi. Now, you know, with C++ 98, if you needed objects, um. Function object. You need to create a class and then do the ceremony.

[01:07:56] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And people found that was very verbose. It was verbose. Now [01:08:00] with Lambos, you can just write, they think tersely, but what you wanted to express, my, so Herb, herb, um, came to be an as the convener in until end of the year, but he, he became the convener for WG one in 2002 after the first, uh, start. So, uh, my, uh, interactions with Herb started around 96, 97, just like when, when I [01:08:30] started because he was very active on comp lung, uh, c plus stress moderated.

[01:08:35] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** He has the, uh, he has this. Quizzes, the group of the week, or it was called that way. So every week has these puzzles, and then he asked the gurus to, to, to, to solve them and explain why to solve. So he was very active, uh, in the, um, uh, in the C++ community online, Usenet and, and, and so forth. And the first time I actually met him in [01:09:00] person was again at the, um, 98th meeting in Sophia Police.

[01:09:05] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Wow. Uh, at the time he was still, uh, sporting the mustache for, for me, when I went to that meeting. There were all these celebrities that I knew only online, so each one of them had contributions one way or the other. But did I foresee the extent of his impact on c plus [01:09:30] plus? No, but I knew he was, like, he was already active on, on the, on used native on C++.

[01:09:35] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So clearly like he, he, he was already, uh, in there. Um, so, uh, 98 was the first time that I, you know, we met, you know, as French speaking, he, he speaks French too, in addition to, uh, to German and of course, uh, English. Um, and, uh, yeah, it was, uh, it was very interesting. And then we met again at A CCU [01:10:00] conferences in 2001 and 2002, he, he signed my, uh, my copies of the book, of his book that, you know, he, he published effective, you know, not effective.

[01:10:10] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, sorry, I forgot. Yeah, I'm blanking on the, on the name. Um. Of the book. He had two books on, uh, forgot the, if you 

[01:10:19] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** don't remember, we'll find 

[01:10:20] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** it. Pop picture of, yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then he, you know, I, I, I remember in 2002, specifically when he joined Microsoft, [01:10:30] um, uh, something interesting happened. Um, he, he put him on stage and we all in audience, we proceeded to boo him because he joined Microsoft

[01:10:45] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Little, so that was 2002. Little did I know that in 2013, I would join him at Microsoft. Right after 98 we got a convener. Then, um, we got Herb, I think was named Convener around [01:11:00] 2002 as well. And, um, so we set out to have, um, we, we put our C++ oh three, which is just a box fix to 98. And then we set out to have.

[01:11:11] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The next major version of C++ and the time, we call it C++ oh x, because, you know, as a programmer we thought it would just be oh 5, 0 6 or oh eight. One of those things, if we followed the five years rule that we thought we had, it would be C++ oh eight. Um, [01:11:30] and Herb was instrumental in working with, uh, Bani and others to make sure that we focused on what we considered at the time at a, the biggest pole, the biggest features that we wanted the next version of C++ two to have.

[01:11:48] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, uh, he was. As every time you build a product near, like when release time is coming, people you know, get nervous and [01:12:00] intentions go right. So near the end things are getting a little bit tense and, and Herb was able to keep everybody together. You know, he's always smiling and even when it is very hard and, you know, it kept, uh, everybody together.

[01:12:14] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, so we, when we got concept into C++ OX, then we had to get them out. Uh, well, it, it. We delayed the standard so that we could put them in. So the convener is the one who is in [01:12:30] charge of making sure that we get the standards on, on, on time, have consensus and, and the standards on time. And then by delaying, he delayed on purpose working with IO Yeah, we, we, we, we'll, we'll come, uh, and to have something in the sun because we thought that's what's going to happen.

[01:12:46] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then a year later coming back, say, uh, herb, sorry, uh, we are wrong because what we thought was going to happen is not going to happen. We need to take it out. That also means we are going to delay further because [01:13:00] when you take something out, a lot of things are hanging in the air and I have to put them back in, in, in some way.

[01:13:05] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So that was, I did work. Uh, and, uh, he, he remarkably got everybody together to, to make it work. And then after we had 11 out, he said, well. This should not happen again. So how do you make sure this doesn't happen again? You build a system around it, you, you turn it into process. So he managed [01:13:30] to convince all the national bodies that we need to have a trained model going to be three years trained.

[01:13:35] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So the three year train became herb's mark, right? Like we got 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, we're going to have 26. So he, he managed to convince people, it doesn't matter if your idea is great, we just have a trade model. Now if your idea is ready, you'll get on a train, although I will take the next train. So I think that's one of the major improvement to the [01:14:00] process that, uh, her brought to the, you know, 

[01:14:04] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** do you have to have a 

[01:14:06] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Yeah, the, uh, the job of, uh, convener it's, uh, hurting car and, uh, that's the only job I would like to have because I don't think I have the, uh.

[01:14:16] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The patient and the tick came kneeling for it. Um, so yeah, so Herb was, uh, convening, I think from 2002 till 2006 or oh seven. Then he stepped down and then we got an interim [01:14:30] convener. Um, and, um, that person who has been like a, a long time member of the C++, uh, community and committee, uh, eventually decided to step down because, uh, as to say the, uh, the, he couldn't get the committee agree on and on a schedule on what to do and then follow that.

[01:14:56] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So yeah, herb, I complain a lot to [01:15:00] him. Uh, but now it, he, he has such a patience, um, to, to make things work and, um, yeah, you, you have to have a thick skin. And not be easily, uh, annoyed by people complaining or calling it out even for things you didn't do. I mean, as a convener, if something goes wrong, they'll complain to him.

[01:15:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** They'll blame him even though he didn't do it. 

[01:15:28] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Because what position did you end [01:15:30] up in? Uh, over time? 

[01:15:32] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So when I started, uh, um, attending the standards committee, I was a member of the National French National Body, and then by 2001, 2002, I became the head of the French delegation. So essentially the guy who gets to communicate between Herb and, and, and the rest, if something need to happen, like, Hey, are there going to be any national body objection to this proposal?

[01:15:58] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, if so, he will [01:16:00] prefer to know in advance what can they do to make sure that the yes turn so no turns into Yes. That's one of the things that a committee need to do, like want to build consensus. If you're objecting to something, what. Can the committee do to turns your no into a Yes. Right. And, and so, and uh, then eventually I, I became more active in features like concepts, modules, or, uh, you [01:16:30] know, concept expert and or just language in general, improvements.

[01:16:34] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, and then as someone who had worked with BNI for a very long time, sometime people would, uh, mistaken me for BNIs, uh, um, um, spoke person, which I'm not. So, uh, when those things happened, well, herb would be kind of making sure that people understood the right [01:17:00] thing and descending arrows at the right person, not at me.

[01:17:04] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So CPL plus 11 was the, a long, uh. Uh, products coming. And of course, by the time we were done with it, many of us were, were exhausted. So, um, you know, to make it very concrete, I worked a long time on concept, right? And [01:17:30] like I mentioned earlier, a version of it got into the standard and then I also had to argue to take it out because it didn't work out the way I I wanted.

[01:17:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and many other people, including Doug Gregor, uh, for example, also worked on, on concept, uh, Jeremy Seek, I mentioned earlier, boost Graph Library, also a key contributor to, uh, to, to concept. Taking something major like that out of the language [01:18:00] is a, a formalization of a failure. To some people, right? So when you spent, I don't know, about 10 years working on something and then went into failure, do you still want to continue working on it or would you like to pursue something else that will use where you can find more success?

[01:18:19] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I think for many it was, well, maybe I can do something else. Uh, so, um, some key members left because [01:18:30] the process was, you know, emotionally intense. Um, and some of them came back. Uh, so, uh, David Abrahams left around 2012. Work constrict along with Douglas continued to work. Like he was the one who started, uh, he was the first chair of the, uh, modules study group.

[01:18:54] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Right. So I remember Doug making a, a, a very good, uh, presentation, uh, [01:19:00] in September, 2013. The first time I was attending the meeting as a Microsoft employee where he, uh, he gave a talk on, uh, his views on, on modules, but eventually, you know, his daytime job as a, a design and implementer of Swift took over the same, you know, with, uh, um, Dave Abrahams earlier.

[01:19:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So a few people after the exhaust, like the long and [01:19:30] exhausting, uh, process of C++ 11, uh, found, uh, wanted to do something new. Uh, some of them came back. Um, well, Dave went to Apple. He, he worked on, uh, on, uh, on it. Was Google on, uh, Google was after, yeah. Yeah. So he, he went, uh, to Apple. He went, uh, he worked as the library architect, uh, on Swift.

[01:19:54] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Uh, right. And, and those was big success. Like he, some of the ideas that he [01:20:00] wanted and he, and, and Doug, Greg wanted into c plus wireless concept that couldn't work out for C++ because of some of the constraint. Like you have efficiency and some other stuff. They were able to make it work for Swift.

[01:20:13] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Yeah. Right. So I think that's a success Boost had a huge cohort of libraries into 11, and then when you just count the number of Boost libraries making it through the, the later versions, it didn't seem the same. [01:20:30] Um, I mentioned earlier that some people would find it curious that, uh, Bush libraries were being fast tracked, were being given preference.

[01:20:41] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I don't think they were, but it just happens that they were the place where people. Went and found an answer to probably had and that had, uh, a, uh, you know, infield experience. It was not just theoretical. Many of the proposals that will go to [01:21:00] WG 21, many of them are theoretical. Very few have concrete infield deployment.

[01:21:06] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** That was not the case for Boost. But yeah, there was that sense that, oh, boost is being given, uh, preference. So it sometimes that played subconsciously into the boat. Another thing that I would say, not to my dear friend, boost is sometimes there is this, um, perception that they're overly [01:21:30] complex in their attempt at covering as many.

[01:21:35] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Compilers as possible. And so sometimes, uh, you know, it, it just too complex like macros, there is macro. That and all the parameterization to cover as many s as possible, um, gave this sense of complexity. So people always like, you know, some people up there like, oh, boost, like, oh, that for them, that equals complexity.

[01:21:59] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** [01:22:00] And another, uh, observation is that for a long time, I think that the situation has improved. Now is that because boost later wanted to reuse components became so in intrinsically entangled that you can't just, let's say, uh, I want to have linear algebra without having any entire boost library. Right now it is more componentization going on.

[01:22:25] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** But at some point, every, if you just need one slide, you need to have [01:22:30] the whole no, uh, slim. When, when the, you have the winds in your back, then you're very happy sometime when you get, uh, headwinds, like it's, it's less, you know, pleasing. Right? Um, the,

[01:22:51] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** the process of getting something into iso C++ standard can be very grueling and you can put in [01:23:00] a lot of effort and then come out with nothing. And depending on people, depending on the time, it can leave a bitter taste. So, um, I don't think all of boost contributors feel that way. Probably some, but I don't think it's a majority.

[01:23:19] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Some have felt like they met all the. Things that were, they tick all boxes. They had filled experience, and yet when they put in [01:23:30] the work to go and, and to standardize, they were rejected unfairly. And that can lead to, you know, uh, not being happy. Mm-hmm. 

[01:23:42] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Can you think of a time when you felt that 

[01:23:44] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** so strongly?

[01:23:45] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Yeah. Me personally? 

[01:23:46] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Yeah. 

[01:23:47] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Oh. Um, but it was on a boost, uh, proposal. Oh, uh, yeah, no, it, it, which 

[01:23:54] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** one was 

[01:23:54] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** it? So, um, it is known enough, uh, had, uh, quite [01:24:00] a few fights with, uh, W WG 21, uh, uh, and um, the, I'll start with the concept, uh, proposal, which I worked on working for over. 20 years before he got into C++ 20.

[01:24:18] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** The first attempt when I actually in 2008 at police, I stood in front of the committee and argued like, we need to have this thing, this standard. And a year later I had to tell BI agree. You need to be taken out. [01:24:30] And it it like you devote a huge part of your life that you're not getting back to something only to see it like just put aside.

[01:24:40] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And then when we did again concept, then we got, uh, concept as a Ts and when we had to get it into 17, we thought we'll get it from the Ts into C++ 17. But, uh, it is a lot of, uh, people in, in the committee that ferociously argue against it. And that was [01:25:00] fairly exhausting and very, uh, trying, I'll put it that way, but I didn't give up.

[01:25:07] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, but yeah, at times, uh, the, the process can seem a little bit, why am I doing this? 

[01:25:15] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What advice would you offer to boost, um, in terms of it having a bright future, uh, in relation to the standards committee standardization and the broader sequence plus ecosystem? 

[01:25:28] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So, uh, [01:25:30] I know the, uh, the Boost community is going through, um, you know, turbulences right now, um, splitting the group into factions is one solution.

[01:25:45] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, is, is that going to be better for the community? So one, one of the things that I learned from beyond a, as as a language designer is like when you have a com, a small community, the cost. Of sustaining [01:26:00] the community or building the tools or infrastructure rest on that small community. But when the community is large, then the cost is spread out and then everybody can shoulder that cost and then feel the exceeding pain.

[01:26:15] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So if you have the community, the Boost community, and then you split it, are you sure that each function will be able to sustain the cost? Depend off what it takes to be [01:26:30] successful in the future. So I don't know what the right answer is, but I'll encourage them to come together just like we have done in the C++ committee, talk through the pains and find ways to continue with the spirits of, uh, uh, of Biman.

[01:26:52] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Well, on that note, how did you, uh, when was the last time. You talked to Biman? 

[01:26:57] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, that was right. The meeting we had [01:27:00] right before, uh, the lockdown. It was in, uh, Hawaii. Uh, what do you remember from that?

[01:27:09] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** So Biman and his wife have always been very, very, uh, kind to me, very supportive. So remember, he, he, he knew me from the very beginning. I was like, baby, right? And he had, um, sorry, I'm getting emotional. It's 

[01:27:27] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** okay. Take your time. [01:27:30] 

[01:27:31] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** He, he had a keen interest in mentoring people. Like, no, if you are young, he'll take you and, and try to help you, teach you what needs to, and not just the programming here.

[01:27:46] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** It is not about, oh, here is what a semicon goes. No, it's about life. Right. No, he is always interested. So he knew about my kid, right? So like, oh, how, how's your son? How's doing Helen? And he knew, but [01:28:00] the family, 'cause he, he saw me from the very beginning and he always had interest in how my life was going.

[01:28:08] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, and sometimes he give me advice on, oh, when things are not going great in the community, well don't worry, have you thought about this this way? And, and that way. And, and, and that meeting in, uh, in 98, um, in, uh, in Kona. So I was there with my son. That was the only [01:28:30] time my son actually came with me at the, at the meeting.

[01:28:33] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** And, um, and, and Biman was. Just full of empathy for what I was going through.

[01:28:43] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** How did you get the news? I assume it was a bit of a shock. 

[01:28:47] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I got it through Bani and, uh, yeah, it was, uh, and I told my son because he, he met him even though he retired actively, he [01:29:00] was still the spiritual leader. Like, you know, it, anybody who has interacted with him, uh, met him. Like, he doesn't come say I'm being my creator of Boost.

[01:29:13] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** No. He just talks to you and then you recognize a natural leader and that's how he impacted people. Every successful organization, and I consider Bush to be very successful, goes through, 

[01:29:28] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** uh, 

[01:29:28] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** renewals. [01:29:30] Right. Even as Biman was alive, it, it already started going through renewal war, right? And then there will be growing pains and we all just have to remember why we came to that place in the first place.

[01:29:47] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Like why we, we came to boost and then remember the original goals, the spirits, and, and carry it out and, and carry it forward. Um, yes, there are challenges now, [01:30:00] personal ambitions and other stuff, but in the end when we remember that it is the community, it is the people. Then how do we want that place to be?

[01:30:13] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** I think that is what should get us. And then the rest, like, you know, writing libraries, those are things that we are doing to occupy ourself, to, to pretend. We really go there to, to, to be, uh, a family community. 

[01:30:29] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Beautiful. Uh, [01:30:30] that feels like the place to end it. Is there anything else you would want to say before we, uh, 

[01:30:34] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** well, thank you for, uh, um, I did not have the questions in advance, so I didn't know exactly what else, what else to get into, but, um, yeah.

[01:30:43] **GABRIEL DOS REIS:** Um, it, it has been a pleasure to see, uh, this product from Bevan affect so much the community and the community. 

[01:30:56] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Uh, thank you. Appreciate your time. Thank you. That was wonderful. [01:31:00] Thank you, sir. That's a cut. We.
