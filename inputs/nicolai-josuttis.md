[00:00:00] 

[00:00:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Hello everybody. I'm Nico Es, I'm coming from Germany and I do C++ for a living. It started 30 years ago, 35 years ago. Uh, first in Germany and then international. So to some extent it's all my fault. Well, there are several others involved, but um, I'm part of it. C++ [00:00:30] has an interesting role in the world, and the role is, it's kind of an outlaw.

[00:00:38] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It's, um, we don't follow rules as they are established and it turns out to be right, the right thing. And, and, and that happened when C++ came up. I mean, we came up with templates and, and everybody said, no, you have to do object oriented programming. And you have [00:01:00] to do it that way. And, but we did it differently and it turned out to be the right decision.

[00:01:06] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and that happened a couple of times. So, um, at the end, I would say never in my, in my career of C++, I would say that people really liked C++. So yeah, they like it. The experts who are the experts and who, who [00:01:30] say I feel, well, I, I understood that, but, but, but the programmers who just have to solve a problem, they said, oh my goodness, C++.

[00:01:40] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But at the end, the performance was so great and performance is key in this world. Performance is both. It's speed and memory resources. I mean, what you have to know is. The Google websites, [00:02:00] if they would be driven in Java, they would need 10 times more energy. And they use a lot of energy in the Google Centers driving all these requests.

[00:02:15] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So performance is the key. Performance is the key. Everywhere. It's, it's, it's if you have software in your, in, in, in, in your medical embedded system, in your body, it's uh, it's uh, it's when [00:02:30] you have stock exchange, you have, um, yeah. Everywhere. 

[00:02:34] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What is a word? Or if you need to, two or three that come to mind when I say boost.

[00:02:42] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Beaming, making the world of c plus pass programming better, giving something back to the community. Um, yeah, kind of that, of course we have to talk about the founder of Boost. I mean, um, you probably do and a lot of [00:03:00] people have done that. And then the interesting thing is how this all started and I was involved then because in, in 1998, I think, uh, I had a discussion with Beammen about how this all started, and then it, it was just some source where we got input and proven input and tested input in the, uh, for the C++ standardization, the standard C++ standard had had a new version every couple of years.

[00:03:28] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and the good [00:03:30] thing was that, that we got something. And, and I think that was a main part and that, that, that's the interesting part of the story that somebody started with, with an idea. Let's, let's come up with, with pre-pro useful libraries and. Simply this idea worked very rebel and, and had a big influence on C++.

[00:03:54] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yeah, 

[00:03:55] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** that's the, and same question then for WG 21 for the ISO committee. [00:04:00] 

[00:04:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Oh, it's the same that, oh, for the ISO committee also, a lot of people just care for C++ by heart and, um, that is good. Um, sometimes recently it changed a little bit that they care more for their personal part of C++, which is an issue in itself because it's too big now for just one person and one one piece of knowledge.

[00:04:25] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So we are, we, we have a, a lack of [00:04:30] generalists to some extent. And, uh, but in general, everybody is interested in, in bringing C++ forward. What C++ would be missing without boost? That's a tricky question. Um. We don't know. We never know. I mean, when we, before the C first C++ standard, uh, we were almost done.

[00:04:54] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We just had some trivial types, like string and IO stream, and we were [00:05:00] almost done. And then, um, somebody came up with a standard library. So, and, and that changed the whole game. And, um, so you never know what happens if boosts not there, or maybe it's, we, we have another source, maybe we have another influence.

[00:05:16] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So I, I would not speculate the world is better or worse with that. It's just, it, it had a big influence and, and that's it. And everything else is speculation and you never know. Um, well, I grew [00:05:30] up, um, and, and I lived my whole life in Germany. Um, my father was, uh, a priest. And later professor in theology and my mother was teaching piano playing.

[00:05:44] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And um, so I was a mixture of, um, caring for value systems and having fun and enjoying life. And that's not just me. Um, I grew up, I was [00:06:00] never a typical hacker. So, um, that I say, oh, I must program 24 7. Um, but it turned out that, um, I felt comfortable programming and, um, by some interest in accidents. I. I, I came across C++ pretty early.

[00:06:18] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um, I thought, oh my goodness, all these, these old people who program in Farran and Cobol, uh, a 30-year-old language. I never wanted to do that. I wanted to do [00:06:30] something modern. Well, I, unfortunately, I'm in that situation right now, 30 years later, still doing C++, but that's probably life. I would not say that there's, well, there, of course there are some relationships.

[00:06:44] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** There always are. But, but the, um, um, the particular thing that I do programming, I would not say that there's something really special. The thing that is special is because I'm also an author of several C++ books. Um, he was also an [00:07:00] author of several books about religion, and so I think I got that from them.

[00:07:06] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and that means being some extrovert and, and caring for, for the world. It's not, it's not natural that, that if you grew up with, uh, with a priest, that, that you are very religious. That that really depends. And, and we had times, I mean, in the, in the seventeens eighties, um, where we came from other ideas of self, um, education [00:07:30] and, and, and getting out.

[00:07:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So, so already there were some questions about the role of reli, religion, et cetera. So, um, no, I I wouldn't say that we have that. It, it's, it's the value system. The value system is something you learn. So what is, what is a good value? Uh, if you give people, if you give something to others, and to some extent coding is that coding is writing programs and, and to the benefit of other people if you do it well.[00:08:00] 

[00:08:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and that I would say, um, is maybe the relationship I can, I can imagine it's not through coding. It's through boost and standardization. I learned a lot of things because, um, that gave me the opportunity to pretty early get together with a bunch of people having different interests, very different cultures meeting, um, three times a year.

[00:08:27] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um, very different [00:08:30] cultures, really very different. And, um, so it, uh, opened the world for me. So, so, and, and we learned something that is way more important now than in the past, which is, uh, compromise, listen, adjust, um, find out what is best without too much, um, too much caring for your own interest. So to some extent, I would say, um, I learned in the standardization and, [00:09:00] and, and boost that the world is way bigger than just my small city.

[00:09:04] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And that. People are much more different than we think. And, and, and so it was a big pleasure for me to go to, to, to, to become open for the world as a whole. Yeah. Well, I would say there, there are couple of answers that come to my mind. Um, first of all, um, it's this joke. How, how you, how can you [00:09:30] distinguish between an extrovert and introvert in it?

[00:09:33] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** How do you Well, the extrovert when you, when you talk to him, looks at your food, not to his own food. That's it. So, um, the general reputation or the general way people see, um, programmers, coders is they are pretty introverts and just caring for coding. Nothing else. But I learned [00:10:00] that, um, in, in, in programming in general.

[00:10:03] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um, they are also the generalists, the extroverts who care for something. They, who give talks, who give trainings, who wanna rule the world. So it's, it's, it's a, it's a big mixture of personalities. What I would say in general is that, um, most of these people are not interested in the usual, um, in the usual way to, to have a good [00:10:30] career, go up and up it up becoming a boss or, so they, they finally, when they want a program, and, and, and that's a little bit tricky or a little bit funny because that means, because everything is driven by it and programs, these people have all the insights, but they, they are not that easy to corrupt by, by having a career or having pressure.

[00:10:52] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** They just, they just are free persons. And, and, and that's, I would say is to some extent a category of, [00:11:00] of these people. They are, they're all. Pirates of the universe. And, and, well, not all, of course, but, but, um, yeah, I see that a little bit. So they're part of the system and to some extent they are not.

[00:11:14] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** They're outside the system and have their own way of living and, and education and, and, and making career. And I think that's a little bit special. But let me say something first. In, uh, 1998, the first c plus [00:11:30] plus standard came out and that was where, where, where I discussed or beam and discussed with me, um, founding Boost as a, as a, as an answer to, to, to peer review libraries.

[00:11:42] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, uh, you know what, in these times we didn't have the internet and it's kind way we didn't have laptops. Um, so think about that. There's also world were the, the best way to communicate and, and the easiest way to [00:12:00] communicate were emails. And, and, and we came together to meetings and, and we, we discussed about things printed on paper, so, so we couldn't try out our program and what we standardized and, but what we thought about, so this world was fundamentally different.

[00:12:19] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It's only 30 years ago, but, but so much, so many things have changed and, and the, and, and, and, and today of course we have other ways to communicate. Um, but [00:12:30] at the end it all started there and, and some of the, some of the ways we standardize were established there and you know, that it's always tricky to have changed.

[00:12:40] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So we, we are still used to that a little bit and although we have a lot of young people who, who joined C++ the C++ community in the meantime, thanks, goodness. Um, we still, um, we still come from that area, so we still. Use emails to discussion we use, uh, [00:13:00] that's even worse. Our, our back tracking system is one HTML page.

[00:13:06] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** How could you do that? I mean, and, and yeah, but it's, it worked and it's hard to change something. And it's 30 years old. It's 30 years old. The, um, my first C++ book was written in German. I was not involved in the international standardization process, and it was a book about the upcoming C++ standard library.

[00:13:29] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, [00:13:30] um, and that, that caused a tension because, uh, didn't exist a book in, in the us And, and, and so the German National Body of Standardization asked me to join and then they asked me to come to the meetings. And then, um, I got in contact with, with BNA and others and, and they said, oh, we need that book in English.

[00:13:54] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So, um. Beyond has this fundamental book about the C++ [00:14:00] programming language. My book was, um, the C++ Standard Library, a tutorial and reference, and, and that was, um, an, uh, a standard book. And in these days, remember we had no internet. Nobody looked, could look up things on the internet. So, um, I know that programmers had my, my book about the c plus or standard library just.

[00:14:21] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** At, at their desk and they wrote that they never handed out, or they have two of them, one at home, one at work or something like that. So it was sold, I don't know, [00:14:30] 100,000 times or something like that. Times have changed. Nobody would do that anymore. They would now look up, uh, C++ in the internet, CPP reference, et cetera.

[00:14:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But in these time, these days, you needed something like that. So, so that was a, that was a history. It's great to feel, to be on, to be famous. How important. Of course. That's great. Um, but, um, yeah, you know, that's a funny anecdote. I, I might be allowed to tell, which is, um, um, the [00:15:00] book, the, the, the English word, the English name is the c plus library.

[00:15:05] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, um, in Germany, the, the attribute V is translated d, DC++ standard, and D is spelled DIE. So I had my German book, first line, DIEC++ second line shall not be boutique. I was sitting the first time in the international [00:15:30] standard meeting, Bian came along and my book was half covered. So all he read was die, C++.

[00:15:38] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And that was how we got in contact. So he, he immediately knew me, that was for sure. And, uh, because what, what the hell is that? And um, he understood after we clarified, but, but things like that happened in these, these times. Bna BNA was, I [00:16:00] was a person who drove his. Idea and vision to the world. He, well, he worked for at and t and um, and Bianna, um, had to fight a lot against other interests, uh, against C++.

[00:16:20] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So there were really some pressure from other things, and he always tried to be

[00:16:29] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** [00:16:30] honest, uh, not rude, uh, drive things forward. He finally gave standardization process to the community, which is a very big decision if you are an author of a programming language. So he, to some extent, gave up control, uh, for the education of C++ or for the development and evolution of C++.

[00:16:55] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** That itself is a big and huge step. And, and, [00:17:00] and that was it. So he. Yeah, he was, he was a reason. We have C++ we can say that, which is, if, if you look at the persons, I know that my, my wife, uh, my former wife, uh, seeing him or a picture of him said, oh, that's your guru, just looking at him as a face.

[00:17:21] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But, but no, it, it's like, like, like the people in, in, in science. And so they, they, they care for what the, they live for their work. [00:17:30] They live for what they do. They are not, um, they are not artists who have to look nice or so, and nothing against, you's not looking nice. But, but you, you, you might know what I mean.

[00:17:40] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I mean, his key interest was the success of C++. And, and you could see, and you could feel that, well, standardization from a formal point of view, like driven by ISO means. Um, make sure existing [00:18:00] practice is portable and usable everywhere. So a couple of important informations are there, like existing practice, it should already be used.

[00:18:09] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And the other thing, it should be supported by multiple companies, in this case, multiple compilers. And, um, but we, we wanted to get rid of that. Different things behave differently on the compilers. So, so, so let, let's ensure that this can be used everywhere as a, as an international [00:18:30] standard. That that's the idea of iso.

[00:18:33] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, but of course you have to be a little bit careful because this is the general idea of iso, but our companies try to abuse that. So they say, oh, let, let's, let's create an ISO standard, but we control it. Uh, something like that. So, so the good thing is that, that. ISO C++ was really driven by community and, and what helped us there a lot was that, that Java [00:19:00] came up.

[00:19:01] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So Java suddenly had all the, uh, had all the focus and, and a lot of companies went there and said, oh, that's a game. We have to spend time there. So, so immediately when Java came up, um. There was less interest in C++, which helped us a lot because, um, the political, the political games ended and, and we, and we could just work and, and, and that was a good thing.

[00:19:29] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I think I, I, [00:19:30] I only hear that because I entered exactly in that period when, when C++ was starting and, and those who just care for, for the mass left C++ and went to Java or other things. And, um, but it, that was part of the reason this committee could work so well together because there were no company having its, uh, its own interest to, to drive something.

[00:19:55] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yes, we had things like that. There are a couple of stories I could tell, but, [00:20:00] um, in principle, this was driven by a community and that's a, a real ISO standard according to the, to the ideal of iso, meaning, yeah, let's, let's, let's make it usable for the mass. And, and those were the times. Yeah. And, uh, um, I knew Greg Colvin, and this is a perfect example of, of, um, what can happen if you standardized.

[00:20:27] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I mean, somebody came up with an idea. [00:20:30] Um, his idea was a smart pointer called Alto Pointer, as far as I know. And that, um, and he had a very clear view, and then it went to a committee and other people had different interests in this, in this particular piece of work. And, and so it, it, it was a little bit screwed up and, uh, and at the end it was screwed up.

[00:20:52] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We standardized alto pointer knowing that there are some flaws inside. Um, and, and, and, and Greg was not happy, I think. [00:21:00] So later on we came up with shared pointers and unique pointers and, and, and, and point, and all these smart pointers were. Were proven and, and and established with using Boost. Yeah. That helped.

[00:21:13] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yeah. But that, that's how far as I remember that. Okay. I'm not sure this is, um, okay. To, to send in a video, but, okay. I, I tell you the way I got in contact with Biman, it's such a nice story. I was in London, I think it was [00:21:30] 96. Um, I know that because I looked it up when he died and, um, there were coming a wife in the elevator.

[00:21:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We were in the lobby of a hotel. So where we standardized. It was my first meeting. I didn't know anybody. And, and, and so down in the lobby, um, there was coming, um, a person with red hair and then a man, not very brown, just this [00:22:00] white or, or red. And, yeah. Okay. Hi, I'm Beman. Okay. And then, uh, came. Uh, a, a woman down with the elevator, that woman looked around, went to B Man, kissed him and, and said to him, oh, may I introduce myself?

[00:22:24] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um, I'm his wife. It. So that was my first experience with [00:22:30] BE. Um, they had a relationship that they were a couple, um, playing games and, and, and a wonderful relationship. And I immediately, um, fall in love to some extent with this way of, of, of entertaining serious work. So, um, we had a lot to do because, um, I was in the, those days only on only dealing with the C++ standard library, and he was a leader of the, uh, standard library working group.[00:23:00] 

[00:23:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, um, so we, we had a lot of time talking and he also. Uh, talked, talked with me later about the, the idea of Booth, but that was the first meeting. So it was, well, the relationship between be Beman and, and Sandra was what I really like. So two, two, um, very, uh, persons being happy in their own. So, so their happiness did not depend on each other.

[00:23:28] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** They were, they were great [00:23:30] people, but together they were an incredible couple and supporting each other and, and, and you could really see how they did enjoy life. And, and, uh, that is something I, I al I also try to do. So nothing against classic romantics relationships where you have, I don't know, a man working and a woman, I dunno, doing, doing other stuff, kids or, so this was, this was a different relationship.

[00:23:57] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** This was a relationship where, where [00:24:00] two very nice people, very. Uh, worry. Um, creative people worry, uh, having confidence work together and, and enjoying life and caring for each other and, and making each other happy. So kind of an, an enrichment instead of ownership, which is sometimes having relationships.

[00:24:21] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I don't know if it's appropriate to say that, but yeah. That, that was my, my feeling. So it was a, a good couple. It was a good couple, and [00:24:30] they, they benefited, did benefit a lot from each other. I, I'm pretty sure, usually I don't remember very well things in the past. I remember feelings, I remember how, but I, but, but I rarely remember exact situations and what happened there.

[00:24:46] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But for some reason, I remember one moment with Biman, and, and that moment was, was when we are more less done with standardization with the first C++ standard in 98. He came [00:25:00] to me, uh, uh, we started a conversation and he said, um, Nico, um, I'm going to be retired. And, and I'm, I have an idea. And the idea is maybe I, I start to create a website where we can, um, peer review C++ libraries.

[00:25:24] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and that was a moment. I mean, that, that was a moment where I said, yeah, yeah. [00:25:30] And, and I said, great, do it. And, and we had a couple of discussions about that because I, I was, I was about finishing my C++ standard library book, and, and I know that I asked him, B Man, um, what's your decision? Do you wanna make that or not?

[00:25:50] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Because I wanna mention it in the book. I wanna, I wanna have footnotes saying, and here you find something else, like, for example, other shared pointer types or something like that. So [00:26:00] you have to make a decision and well, if you, if you want that, I mention it in this book. And, and, and so, so it happened that, yeah, at the end, uh, you said in November, but, but at the end he decided to run this website and, and, and that was it.

[00:26:16] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** That was it. So retirement was probably one good reason for that. So he, he, he decided to have to have another, another, another useful thing in his life for, for work or to, [00:26:30] to create something, you know? I know it was in 98. Uh, it could be nice. I, it could also be somewhere in the States. I, I actually, I, I simply don't remember.

[00:26:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I, but I remember the room. I don't remember the city. 

[00:26:42] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What do you remember about the room? 

[00:26:43] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Oh, the room was, I mean. In those days, uh, in these, in these days, we are driving C++ by 200 and more people. But in those days we were only something like 30 to 40 people and meeting and, and we are sitting in this room.

[00:26:57] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We had a final discussion, which [00:27:00] by the way was about out to point up out the pointer was the last decision for this C++ standard. Okay. And, uh, and we saw, solved it out. Then we had a hand vote and then, uh, we were there. So we were all together in a room, traditional conference room, uh, meeting room, just going around each other.

[00:27:24] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** As I said, no laptops, no internet, just sitting there and, and, and voting [00:27:30] and say, oh, we're done. Right. So he was one of the guys driving it from IBM. Robert Clara was one of the guys driving, uh, this, uh, at IBM and yeah, it was fun. It was fun to work with all of them to sit at the bar to learn about life.

[00:27:45] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, um, he was one of that I think I was not involved in in these meetings, but, but they were there for sure. I mean, most of, most of the, the things that when you meet and, and have ideas and if you meet in person, things like that [00:28:00] happen. And, um, it's just that they, that they praying came to me pretty late.

[00:28:05] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I was, I was involved, but I would not say I was a key player those days in these things. I still not, I'm still, I still am not. But, um, um, so C++ standardization was, yeah, some people were discussing ideas with others and sooner or later they came, they opened it more and more and more. And there was a moment when they came to me and [00:28:30] I didn't know that that robot was a key person there, um, to, to, to make the decision.

[00:28:37] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** All I know from my experiences, Beman came to me and told me, I want to drive this website. How do you. What do you think about that, that idea? I would say he discussed, oh, Leman discussed the idea of coming up with Boost with me before he reserved the website, because I remember that, um, he, he told me [00:29:00] or sent me an email saying, oh, I have reserved the website now.

[00:29:05] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I was excited about the idea having Boost. I'm not sure I, I understood how big it is. So, um, at the end it was just an idea of some guy, uh, maybe we drive some libraries. I mean, how often do we have that, that people say, oh, let, let's have a cool platform these days especially, and there we make all the work and then we can [00:29:30] rule the world, uh, or, or can the world can benefit from us.

[00:29:33] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** A lot of people have ideas. The point is whether this idea works, and that depends on so many things. Like do we have enough time? Um, some things you cannot control, like who's contributing? Uh, are people interested? Um, to some extent. Um, as I said, in in those days, Java was the programming language.

[00:29:59] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** [00:30:00] Everybody was looking for Java, so, so C++ was kind of a niche in, in programming and, um, so I thought, yeah, great. Do it. And I thought, yes. I, I definitely said to him, yes, do it. Please do it. And, and that's good. We need that. But, but having, I, I had no, I could not guess about how well this will work, but it turned out it worked well, that's all.

[00:30:28] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** How would you mean? [00:30:30] So this is, first of all, um, we say. We have no central place where we can find out, um, or where we can create innovative C++ libraries and test them upfront because as I said, standardization means, [00:31:00] um, that there's existing practice. We make sure it's portable and, but for that we need existing practice.

[00:31:07] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So how can we standardize something new in the library without having the existing practice? So there are two approaches. One is a company would come up with some proprietary solution, or we come up with something peer reviewed, which is used in a, in a couple of places. So it was pretty clear that we needed a point for that.

[00:31:29] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** That we, that we [00:31:30] needed someplace where we say, oh, next time we come up in the C++ standard library, we, we, we had enough time and we have enough experience that we know this is usable as it is. And as it, as it was designed and as it design was changed over time, that would be the idea. That was a basic idea of boost.

[00:31:51] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And I would say that idea worked well. So it, it didn't work perfect, but it worked well. And, uh, [00:32:00] so, um, and, and, and then the other, the secondary goal mentioned here is that we, uh, um, provide a focal po uh, uh, a focal point for programmers to participate in a wider community. And that is also true. I mean, um, it turned out that, that, that programmers said, oh, oh, this is a natural spot to look for.

[00:32:25] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Interesting libraries. So this is kind of the app store [00:32:30] 30 years ago for C++. So, um, and, and, and that also worked, uh, a lot of libraries came from there. So especially if we look in, in the next C++ standard, which came out in, in 2011, uh, a couple of things were adopted from there, there were at least a dozen batteries adopted.

[00:32:49] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yes. Um, over time. Definitely. And, and, and they were very, very important. Definitely. And, um, by the way, that has changed, [00:33:00] um, maybe you come to there later, but the, um, the impact of Booth has going down. So, so in, in those days, this was the, the holy grail of library world and, and people were looking there and, um, yeah.

[00:33:16] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** If, if you had a library and you thought it's, it's worth. To standardize it sooner or later, uh, that the community can benefit from it. You ship the to boost that was, that was a status [00:33:30] quo in, in those days. Yeah. Um, the idea is not to set up an organization which happens to have a website, rather. The website is the organization.

[00:33:48] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And like all good websites and all good organizations, it will evolve over time. A couple of of person come to my mind who, who played a, a, an important key role [00:34:00] at the beginning. Uh, I remember that we had this initial site with, I don't know, six to 10 people having all some crazy photo. Um, so, um, probably the most important name is Dave Abrahams.

[00:34:19] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Who, who was to some extent the other person of Boost for a long time. And, uh, but also did Mark who [00:34:30] did a lot and, and, uh, Alistair Meredith, I think. And, um, yeah, Greg Colvin, of course, and, um, robot probably. Yeah. So, um, it's, uh, no, but, but the one name I remember and who had a big impact and drove this a lot was Dave Abrahams, you, you, you cannot report about Booth without, uh, talking to Dave.

[00:34:59] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** He, [00:35:00] Dave was at, was there at the standardization process of C++, um, early. He left. Pretty early then. Um, I don't remember exactly when it was, so it was around end of nineties, maybe a little bit later still. But in that, in that time, he was also part of the standard committee. Yes.

[00:35:26] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I don't know the details, but if you, if you look, if you look [00:35:30] around, if you, if you have a cool idea, there are people who, who drive it internally and there are people who drive it externally. And to some extent, Dave was more externally proposing it and caring for content, trying to come up with patterns and, and, and, and some rules and, and, and style issues.

[00:35:53] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So, so questions like that. Uh, I would say, uh, as Beman is not such an [00:36:00] extrovert person. Dave definitely is more extrovert than him. He was more visible to the community as part of Boost than Beman. Well, of course they could work together, but

[00:36:19] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I assume they had their issues. Let me say it that way. Um, but I don't wanna say something more about it. So it was a constructive way [00:36:30] to work and I only have impressions. I don't have enough insights with her more, but, but I, I think, you know, they were not running Boost in a way that, but we are two friends.

[00:36:41] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We always spend together. We, we, we, we work together. I think they, they have discussions about how to deal with it. Um, but that's just an assumption. Um, that's just an observation from the outside. And, uh, I don't wanna, yeah. I want, I don't want to [00:37:00] go into details because that's speculation. Okay. Let's, let's talk about STD array and how it became a C++ standard.

[00:37:06] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um, it was clear right from the beginning when we standardized the C++ containers in the especially vector that we said, oh, we must have one, uh, tape where the, where we have a fixed size container. So, um, you cannot insert or delete elements. And the benefit is we don't need, um, dynamic [00:37:30] memory to start.

[00:37:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So it's pretty cheap to have it, um, as a replacement for ordinary arrays or as an add-on or a simplified use of ordinary Aries. But with the standard API of containers, which is we can iterate over the elements with Iterators have beginning and, and, and, and so on. So, um, that idea was not coined by me. I, I in my life.

[00:37:53] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I never coined any idea. I just. Discuss it and bring it further. So, and um, the [00:38:00] idea actually came from BNA str. So BNA has, in his C++ programming language, basic book, he has an example of a class like that. And, and I remember that I took it and said, oh, that's useful. Somebody has to do the work.

[00:38:20] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So I took it and said, let me prepare for Boost. So I took his idea from that book [00:38:30] and brought it to Boost. That's all. And I think that that's all of my contribution to S-C-D-R-A. And, um, then, uh, later on, um, in those days I was not so involved in C++. I was, there was a gap where, where I did, where I did some other things, Alistair Meredith came to me and said, uh, hey, would you mind that we propose, uh, SCD area for the C++ standard?

[00:38:57] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And um, for C++ 11? [00:39:00] I said, no, no, do it all fine. Um, I, I didn't look into details and uh, so, so it was Alistair who made it really a C++ standard library. So my point was only the bridge between B'S idea and Alistair who brought it into the c plus blast Center. So, and, and, and that was Boost.

[00:39:22] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yeah. I mean, um, okay. S-C-D-R-A, um, was an [00:39:30] idea. Everybody had talked about that. I. It wasn't beyond's book, but also during the standardization process, we said, oh, we need this thing. Uh, it's obvious that we also have to have that. And, uh, but nobody did the work. I mean, that, that's our key problem. We have a, we have in C++ standard library, a lot of people have a lot of bright ideas, but somebody has to do the work.

[00:39:53] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And the work is, um, make a formal proposal, uh, think about the [00:40:00] exact API discuss it with others, and so on and so on. So that class is pretty straightforward. So there's not, not, there are not too many things to discuss when you think about that. And, um, so I, I took the, the, the, well, the i, the, the simple implementation of B'S book and brought it to Boost.

[00:40:24] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And in those times, that was very early because it was right. Right after CBL was 98. When, [00:40:30] when Boost just started, uh, we were a very small group. We didn't have established, um, um, a big peer review process or so we just said, oh, it, oh, that's a good idea, let's take it and do it. So I would not say we had a lot of reviews.

[00:40:45] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It was more that, uh, or that we have a lot of validation or, or thinking and, and discussing the design. It was more that I brought it up and said, here, here's a library I would propose, oh, thanks. Goodness. Great. And [00:41:00] we need something like that. That was a work about let's, let's have some early content and, and, and, and it was more or less come up with a website, come up with a, with some text describing the thing and come up with a source code and that's it.

[00:41:16] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I mean, and, and, and then we put that then on this website in some way at it. That was at the beginning because it was not, not Boost was not that. Famous already. It was just. [00:41:30] Starting and, and, and all the, all the processes for to peer review and have an official docu, uh, discussion about should we accept that?

[00:41:40] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Should we accept that in that way, how you should, you should follow the guidelines we have, et cetera. All this discussion came later because all this processes came later because, um, booth grew and grew and, and it grew to, to a, to a level where we needed some rules to [00:42:00] maintain this software as a whole because at the end we shipped Booth as a whole together.

[00:42:06] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So you need some consistency and, and the way this is, uh, this is shipped, this is, um, programmed, this is documented. And, and, and, and that, but that came later. That came pretty sure after I proposed STDA for boost. But I, I, I cannot help that own way. I cannot help that. No, I have to say that I think that was really driven by Dave [00:42:30] Abrahams and Beman together, and they said, so, you know, we have to, we have to bring it forward and we have to make this whole process more mature.

[00:42:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But I was not involved in that. Sorry. The peer review, the, the process. How do we accept libraries for Boost and what is required to have a library for Boost? And what are the quality gates? So, I mean, the, yeah, I mean, we had to [00:43:00] protect a situation where just some guy had a, had some idea which was lousy, implemented, and shipped the library and said, oh, that should be on booth.

[00:43:11] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** That's not what we want. We want, we want something that that's for the US that might come to the C++ standard library. So we needed quality. And how do we bring in quality? I mean, um, maybe because I'm in, I was in the standard committee for S-C-D-R-A, [00:43:30] there was no, not so much peer review because I knew all the rules of the, of the c plus West containers.

[00:43:36] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But, um, for other people, we needed rules. We had to say, okay, um, we have to make sure that we, that we, that we create good libraries. And it's not a repository of just some libraries and some crazy, excuse me, or, or even worse ideas. My experience is whatever your [00:44:00] process is, if, if those who who review are idiots, crap falls out and.

[00:44:08] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And I would say the biggest benefit was that, that, that they had the connections for good people, for experienced people who knew what is what is important. So, so Beammen, um, was able to, to bring together the right people and also himself [00:44:30] to say, no, that's not good enough. And I would say that was it. I mean, of course they established some rules as, I dunno, the first stage where you propose a software and then there's a second stage where when we accept it or, or we have a process, two or three people that should look at that.

[00:44:47] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** But, but the key point is the quality of the reviewers, the quality of people who look at that. Nothing formally can review a C++ library, whether it's good or not. Um, [00:45:00] you need good. Generalists who have seen enough and can abstract a lot because what is so special about C++ standard libraries is they don't fulfill a purpose of a specific domain.

[00:45:19] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** They, they, they are the basics for a lot of general data processing in very different domains under very [00:45:30] different circumstances. That is different. You, you have to look more in, in more general way or to some things and say, oh, is this usable by a mainframe? Is it usable in an embedded system? Is it usable by, um, by, um, medical software?

[00:45:49] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Is it usable by finance software? And, and so, so these were the things that matter. And, and, and, and C++ has this role, C++ is [00:46:00] completely, um. Independent from any specific domain where programming is used, it's, it's, it's your tool for programming in general. And, and that means something also for the libraries.

[00:46:13] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** The libraries have to be good enough to work at very different places. And, and, and for that, you need the right people to, to have enough well vision, to have enough experience, to have enough, uh, [00:46:30] courage, uh, and don't take themselves too important to, to accept things like that. For the mass, I was not involved in the, in the discussion about license, but I was involved in, in several open source software.

[00:46:46] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I mean, open source became public and, and in general in it. And, and that was also the case with Boost. But Boost was a great example about how good the quality can be in, in open source. How can [00:47:00] we protect this software and at the same time ensure that this is, uh, usable by everybody and it's not used.

[00:47:10] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and that's a key question. So you need some rights because that, otherwise everybody can make everything out of it. But on the other hand, these, right, these rights should not restrict usability of the system. And, and I know that this was all a huge, complicated discussion and, and we [00:47:30] had over the past maybe 20 years, and not only in C++ this, this was in general in it, the, the, the question is what is the right uh, way to, to protect open source software was big.

[00:47:46] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And um, and I think boost. It was only one example where they came out with some solution. Unfortunately, we have different ways how C++ code is standardized. Now, I, I recently [00:48:00] took some code from GCC and, and had a big issue because I did misuse that something and, and, and so it's really tricky and yeah, creative comments was a big improvement, but also, I think as far as I know, the Boost Library did a good job.

[00:48:17] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So they, they said, yeah. Um, I'm not aware of any, any, any complaints, any discussions about, um, we did it wrong or we, we, we protect the wrong things. Uh, [00:48:30] so, so it was obviously a pretty good library. Good, pretty good license that was used by Boost, but I was not involved in that. Uh, and I would say we definitely have more freedom than the usual other open source licenses we have before Creative comments.

[00:48:46] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Mm. So, uh, I would say that's my understanding, but I, I never looked it up. Uh, I was not involved in the formal discussions about that from [00:49:00] Boost. We had smart pointers, the later smart pointers from Boost, we had the file system library, um, yeah, TD area, some other containers. Um, boost had a lot of impact on TD thread, uh, so libraries, so also the Chrono library, although, um, so partially we did [00:49:30] not take it from there.

[00:49:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So, um, optional, I think variant and also was there, uh, came to there. So, so at least we had for all these key. Um, key new pieces of software, of basic software. Um, we had, um, a lot of, uh, existing implementation at Boost. So Boost, um, no, broaden some [00:50:00] stuff. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling like an idiot. Like I cannot name that.

[00:50:04] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** I can read you a little Peter's answers. He said he, uh, he used to love his shared pointer, weak pointer the most, but now he loves MP 11, which is a later one. Um, you know, the ones that were standardized. We got smart pointers function and buying tuple, RegX, unordered map, unordered set type traits, random krono, partially array.

[00:50:27] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Um, he thought the most notable of those of the standardized [00:50:30] was function. And then he goes, oh, serialization too. It became the defacto standard for C++ serialization. And then he was like, Python and graph were fairly popular and innovative. And then he said Lambda was groundbreaking. And then he points to Osseo as a more recent thing that he was impressed by.

[00:50:46] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Any of those jump out at you that you want to, like, talk about why you think they're important or I'm 

[00:50:53] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** surprised a little bit. Okay. 

[00:50:55] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What, what's, what you surprised 

[00:50:56] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** about mean? Uh, a couple of things. I mean, uh, Lambda is a language feature [00:51:00] on a library feature. So, um, and what is a little bit funny is, so the range based fall up to some extent was first a small library and that was then became a language feature.

[00:51:11] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So it seems maybe we had some issues there. I, I agree with, with, uh, the containers who, who had implementations there. Yeah. Chrono, I, I, I said yeah, but that, that the real chrono implementation was not the Boost Library. And, uh, so the ideas came from there. A [00:51:30] couple of ideas came there. I would say yes. Um.

[00:51:34] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Type traits. So type functions that that was their programmed in a very constructive way. I would not, I would not say Rex, because we consider from, from the current point of view, the current implementation of Rex as not very usable from a per performance perspective. So we think this was not an, a success story.[00:52:00] 

[00:52:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, uh, yeah. So I forgot the other things you have said. So, so I'm, this is a little bit too much praise for me and uh, uh, 

[00:52:12] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** scale it down a little bit. Yeah, yeah. 

[00:52:14] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Scale it well. The impact was big, but, um, there was, one thing I learned is that pretty often. What we had in at Booze was not, um, standardized. It was more that we had, um, a basic idea [00:52:30] and then somebody came up with a, with a concise, um, con, uh, consistent library and, and said, oh, and that's a version I wanna ship and came up with, with a few other ideas.

[00:52:42] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** In addition, and especially what also happened is when we had, um, a library standardized at Boost, it uses the existing language features and, and, but at the same time, while it, while we had evolution in the, in, in the C++ library, we had evolution in the C++ [00:53:00] call language. So the call had then had an impact what we could do in the libraries.

[00:53:05] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So that led to the fact that we adopted a couple of technologies. We established and proved well at Booth, but at the end, the, the real standardized source code looked a little bit different than that. And then we had back parts. So then we said, oh, now, now, now for example, when we have variant, um, the variant implementation then came to standardization.

[00:53:29] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We thought, [00:53:30] no, let's do it a little bit different. And then it came back to Boost and said, we have a new version of its library at Booth, which is more standard conforming. So that happened a couple of times. I think I can give you an example about the difference, um, between standardized, uh, um, putting something to boost or making it a C++ standard.

[00:53:51] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And the example I know because I was involved a little bit was, um, the file system library. The file system [00:54:00] library was one of the first very big libraries we had. So we had, yeah, we need a portable w way to iterate over, uh, to, to deal with the file system to create directories, um, navigate through directories, sub directors, et cetera.

[00:54:14] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Uh, dealing with symbolic links and so on. And, um, we had, we had a, a pretty good implementation there, uh, at Boost. And, and, and that was used a lot. [00:54:30] And, and, but a few things happen when you use Boost because we immediately got in trouble with backward compatibility issues. So, uh, boost had the idea that these libraries should work from C++ 98 to any other C++ version, and that costs some issues.

[00:54:51] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and so if you look at the source code of, of Boost libraries, a lot of macros are there, which mean they have [00:55:00] special handling for specific versions for specific platforms to make this really portable. And, and um, and then also, um, to some extent we had this file system library and booth. It was used.

[00:55:15] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It was okay. And then we put it to standardization. And I know that because I was in the, in the group adopting the Boost five system library for the C++ standard. So we discussed that [00:55:30] and Biman was also in that group. And, and, and I found out and said, oh, that's weird. Here's something weird.

[00:55:36] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Here's something weird. Here's something weird. And, and a few things. So some things, for example, came out and turned out to be a problem because on Windows it seemed that we didn't do a good job there. That Well, similar, too much differences. And, and, and looking back, I would say yeah, a boost to some extent had [00:56:00] its community.

[00:56:00] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And the community was more on open source and that was more in the nux area. And they didn't have all the, didn't see all the problems we had on Windows and, and, and, and to some extent, window, window people or Microsoft, I don't know, didn't care enough. That this is a good library for also their platform.

[00:56:20] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and so we had some flaws there. I would consider it as flaws. And, and, and so we came up during the standardization, I would [00:56:30] say we, we, we, we, we double checked what we have there. And surprisingly, even for a library that existed for five to 10 years and was maintain at Booth, we thought, no, we cannot make it that way.

[00:56:45] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** That's not good. Let's, let's, let's, let's make it more robust. Let's make it more portable. Or why didn't we, did we never think about this thing? So I see some, some tech, some, some mechanisms, uh, that [00:57:00] again and again about standardization and, um, existing practice. So somebody came up with an idea, this is discussed, and then we take it as it is, even if it has flaws.

[00:57:14] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and if that's a Boost Library, then this Boost Library stays there with these flaws, um, until it gets standardized and then suddenly we have an opportunity to look at it again and say, oh, let's make it better. And, and [00:57:30] that happened a couple of times. So to some extent you can say the first standardization happens at Booth, then it's used a couple of time.

[00:57:38] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And then the second standardization is, is a rethinking version two or 0.0 of, of these libraries also taking the new, um, language features into account. So I would say that's a difference in C++ 11. I don't have memory memories about a lot of [00:58:00] heated discussions. I mean, yes, we have them 

[00:58:03] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** straightforward.

[00:58:04] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Yeah. Um, so for example, the five system library, when we adopted that, that was a group of five people. Going through it and, and discussing it and, and it was not, it was not important enough. Um, okay. So, um, the, the type traits were well established. S-T-D-R-A was obvious, so, [00:58:30] um, we had other discussions and when we standardized, and that can be very heated, definitely.

[00:58:36] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, uh, and, uh, for example, when dealing with threats, there were a lot more discussions about that area. And, um, no, I think

[00:58:51] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I have to think carefully what I, what I'm, what I'm able to say without getting trouble. Um, if, if this goes [00:59:00] to public at the end, please note we are, we are a group of people and we need a, we need a safe spot to discuss. And, and, and that's important when we go to public that, that it's clear. Yeah, we have heated discussions, but, um, if, if what we, what we discuss there is no longer possible to discuss, we hinder ourself and, and we, we, we don't, cannot come up with quality.

[00:59:27] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Um,[00:59:30] 

[00:59:33] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** yeah. So, um, threat, CD threat was a, a type that had,

[00:59:50] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** that had a flaw. And the flaw was, um, it was not one of the well designed c [01:00:00] plus plus objects where you say, oh, at the end of the lifetime everything, everything is cleaned up automatically. Which we call the RI AI principle in C++. Um, no, you had to, um, kind of call a cleanup function, which we try to avoid because, um, when things clean up automatically if you use them, you don't have to think about cleaning up and thinking about cleaning up [01:00:30] is sometimes very complicated because you don't know how things end, how in which situation we we are and what are the dependencies and so on.

[01:00:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So, um, in that case, we all agreed that the way, um, C++ STD threat is standardized is not okay. And we had a big vote on that. And, and at the end, um, there was [01:01:00] not enough political support. Uh, to fix the flaw. We all agreed even before C++ 11 about that. So, um, it should be a type that, that cleans up better.

[01:01:15] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So let me say that way. And, uh, and we shipped that finally, and then we found out that the community is starting to wrap it because we didn't solve the cleanup problem [01:01:30] correctly. And, and, and, uh, I was involved because I always said, we have to fix that because I, I see that, I teach that. And I, they asked me, why the hell is it that way?

[01:01:41] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And so at the end, uh, we found too much use of, uh, abuse of threat, and we saw that the fixes were really bad and, and we had to come up with a new type. And as we are backward compatible, we, we couldn't use, we couldn't fix St threat anymore. We had [01:02:00] to call it SDJ threat and. That of course is not a good story because, um, we, we could have done it right at the beginning.

[01:02:08] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** On the other hand that the new type has has its benefit and it's, it's, it, it's, it has also its benefit that we have both types now. Yeah. But, but, but this is, this is something we have in general to some extent, I would say Boost is not different than any other C++ project in the world. And the C++ standard is just one c plus [01:02:30] plus project.

[01:02:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and the project is, uh, the problem is this is software. It's maintained over years. This is highly, uh, highly fragile software and it is grown over years to some extent. You can say C++ is 50 years old because we still are based on the programming language. C which was, um, invented in, in 1972.

[01:02:56] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, um, that means we. [01:03:00] Because we are backward compatible, we cannot easily fix things because it would break existing code somewhere. And, and that, that's a problem that C++ in general has. That's a problem each and every project has. That's a problem Boost has And, and, and the standard has, and as I said before, when we, when we take the example of the FI system library, um, the FI system library, uh, we, we had the opportunity once [01:03:30] we take the existing backboard compatible boost library and put it to the C++ standard, that's now something kind of new because it's a FI system library of the C plus West Standard, which is kind of different than the FI system library of booth.

[01:03:44] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We could, to some extent, make fixes we always wanted, but, but we would not break existing code because it's new code. Because it's, it's not in the, in the name spaces, in the areas of the existing code. C++ 11 changed, c plus [01:04:00] plus changed the way we program in C++. And, um, it's a little, if, if you look at, at what was invented, well for the first time, part of the standard it was programming with types, like type rates coming or pre, pre, um, implemented at Boost.

[01:04:24] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It was, um, alto, the keyword alto, it was, uh, range [01:04:30] based follow loop. It was lambdas. And I think these are the most important things. And, and that changed the way we program, um, or maybe uniform initialization so we could initialize, could containers directly with elements and um. A couple of things became much more usable, uh, easier to program, and, and [01:05:00] we, we did, we could hide a few things away.

[01:05:02] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Like, um, we suddenly had what, what we an it call a for each loop and, and which we didn't have before where we had to use iterators and that that needed some technical experience and some deep insights. And so it was a basics of everything that came from that. Um, I can't imagine [01:05:30] how the world would look like without C++ 11.

[01:05:33] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** It's uh, but the funny part is that the two things that changed everything, the whole game was the keyboard, er, and the key and the range space, follow the range. Bus follow was the, for each loop. Which we surprisingly didn't have. We have it in each and every other language. And, and, and it was, I think it was something coming from Boost and we had that as a, as a library feature, as a, as a helper function with some flaws.

[01:05:59] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** [01:06:00] So we made that a language feature and Alto means that we were able to say, um, you don't have to specify the type, the compiler found out, the type, find out the type. That was so important because we could come up with types that are so some complex that nobody wants to write them explicitly. And if you now see where there's all led [01:06:30] to, we have now typed that that take, that would take, if you write them literally, um, take, I don't know, 100, 200 characters.

[01:06:40] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Just, just, just saying this is that type, because this is a, this is a filter of, of a transformation of a, of a, of a, of a, of a dropping of, of, of, of a, of an iteration, of a, a container of elements. We have this type and that type. So this [01:07:00] type, these types are so complex that nobody wants to write them down.

[01:07:04] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** They are created on the fly, which is kind of where pro programming language that are not so type bound can be better because they say, oh, you don't see the type. You just create something and we track the type internally and suddenly we put that in C++ with better performance because the type was still computed at [01:07:30] compile time.

[01:07:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** C++ 11 was a point where we, uh. Open C++ for a new generation of programmers. I would say it was a necessary step to become, uh, to, to, to switch from a more academic, uh, tricky way of programming to more straightforward, say what we want. And, and it turned out that with c [01:08:00] plus plus, the people who started to standardize C++ suddenly grew up really to think after 10 or 20 years, uh, programming language is dying on laundry.

[01:08:10] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** A few people standardize it. No, a lot of people came in and said, oh, oh, now it gets really interesting. And a lot of young people came in and said, now it's interesting. In c plus, in the c plus one standard committee, there's a directions group. They think about. General directions, where we go to and where we want to be and, and be [01:08:30] honest there and, and a few others.

[01:08:31] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And they think about the vision, what is the goal and, and, and how. Also make sure we don't follow all the, all the, all the new stuff just because it's, it's, it's used everywhere. Let's make sure we find our place. We, we are not deep programming language for everything, but we try to be a good programming language that is between, um, manually writing every bit and, and, and, and still having an abstraction [01:09:00] level where we can solve problems a lot.

[01:09:02] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** And, and, and there's no room for, for better performance when you have to write big software systems. And that's the world we are in. We have big software systems, but it should be incredible fast. So the effect of C++ is not that somebody controls how this is used, it's more that over time. Useful things win.

[01:09:27] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** Hmm. So even if there's [01:09:30] pressure from government and who says, uh, well you have to use that programming language or that, uh, that can some discussion. Is C++ safe enough or not? At the end, the question is, does our software solve our problem with, um, not too much resources and with good speed? And, and so far there, there is not really a mature other alternative than C++.

[01:09:56] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So I would say we did the right decisions in c plus [01:10:00] plus 11 to make, to provide more modern features to, to make it easier to come up with more high level features. But at the end, the success story is that this is still a language that has great performance and, and that's at the end what matters in this world.

[01:10:17] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** What change? Why, why, why has the influence of boost? Decrease is an interesting question, I would say. But that's my personal opinion. And, and, and I [01:10:30] know that in the standard committee, a lot of people would not agree with Matt or say, oh, you are German. You always formulate things too harsh. But I would say, um, we lost the general view of C++.

[01:10:46] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** So we have too much people caring for a specific part of it, a specific way to use it, and we [01:11:00] more and more invent on the fly. So we, we don't take our time to say, let's, let's establish things at Boost, take 3, 5, 7 years, and then we know how it should be, and then we standardize. No. More and more we invent libraries and why we standardize, and that's a huge mistake we have.

[01:11:27] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We have made a lot of mistakes [01:11:30] in the recent standardization. Others would not say it that way because it's our baby. But at the end, this is a programming language for me. And this programming language has a problem that that 200 cooks spoil the meal. So, um, we have 200 different interests and we do no longer take our time to make it really a robust, [01:12:00] good, well established library.

[01:12:04] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** We no longer put libraries at Boost and. We, we come directly with a solution. So Boost, it's, it's a pain that, that the role, that the role of Boost decreased. But, but this is the time. Everybody wants to have every solution immediately, [01:12:30] and they want to have that as a c plus press center. I'm a little bit frustrated about that, but I'm, it's my right.

[01:12:39] **NICOLAI JOSUTTIS:** I'm old enough.
