[00:01:25], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, early_era
"What, well, I started, uh, working with Boost early on. Um, I was fortunate, uh, to have a number of really good graduate students and postdocs."

[00:01:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, jeremy-siek, history
"Um, we started. Getting involved with this, probably 1999, 2000, uh, probably first was my, uh, graduate student at the time, Jeremy Siek."

[00:02:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, generic-programming, meta-programming
"And we were one of the goals behind and, and where the Boost Graph Library came from was we were really interested in trying to apply this new, at the time, new programming, paradigm of generic programming, which leveraged a lot of the, uh, advanced features of C++."

[00:02:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, community, open-source
"We ran across the Boost community, which was just getting started as well. And, um, it was a natural match at the time."

[00:03:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, open-source, community
"I also made a transition from teaching at the University of Notre Dame to teaching at Indiana University. And I was, um, heading up a lab there, research center called the Open Systems Lab, which was looking at well open systems, open software, and again, boost was a innovative example of that, both in terms of our personal interest of its technology, but also in its, um, emerging and somewhat novel at the time. Um, open source model."

[00:03:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, libraries
"I had a research group when I was at first at Notre Dame and then Indiana. That contributed a large number of libraries to the boost, uh, collection. And also were, uh, kind of foundational in helping to get it off the ground."

[00:04:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, meta-programming, technical
"With, with templates, you could actually. In some ways really actually change the language to add features that you might want. And what Boost did, besides trying to provide a lot of high quality libraries, was also leverage some of these advanced features of C++, and particularly the template system via the process of template matter programming to really extend what the language itself could do."

[00:10:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, community, technical
"I think what some of the feeling was was that, um, in boost in particular, it did bring together a, a very particular community of very, very bright, uh, programmers. And again, they were really trying to, um, push the language forward, uh, by leveraging some of these mechanisms in C++."

[00:11:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, meta-programming, technical
"And one of the things that, uh, was going around at the time when, uh, generic programming was first emerging and this template meta programming was just emerging, was that it was an accidental side effect of the template, uh, system."

[00:12:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, bjarne-stroustrup, technical
"And I, it wasn't. So when the template system was being developed and was being designed by Bjarne and others, I, I was not part of that at the time. It would've been, you know, mid, early to mid nineties when it was being developed. Uh, they deliberately made, uh, design decisions to open up, uh, the possibility of new things to make it flexible and, uh, composable extensible, I don't think they knew in particular would end up with this thing, but they knew that if they made it. Uh, sufficiently flexible that something could happen, something would happen."

[00:20:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, stl, generic-programming, history
"And then I ran across the standard template library and, you know, the scales, the time, the scales just kind of fell from my eyes and I realized, yes, this is the way to write a program once and be able to reuse it in all of these different situations that you might, uh, come across."

[00:21:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, stepanov, personal, history
"And, um, my wife struck up a conversation with his wife and, um, you know, she came to me later, so we're having dinner with Alex. And, uh, so she arranged that, uh, I had several of my students with me, including Jeremy. And so yeah, we just struck up. Um, uh, great. Uh, well, what became a great friendship? Alex is one of my best friends, my dear friends."

[00:22:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, stepanov, history, stl
"All because of Wendy, yeah. Have to give her a shout out. Well, so Alex, at the time I met him, um, it was maybe at the peak of his, um, for lack of a better word, the peak of his powers. Um, it wasn't too long after he had developed a standard template library, and I think there was a feeling, uh, he had a certain mystique about him, and I think it was a certain awe because he's one of the most, well, um, educated, well-rounded, well-read people that I know."

[00:23:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, stepanov, philosophy
"And so, um, his idea, for instance, in, um, creating the standard template library was really to bring, uh, princip. Principles of mathematics, uh, theoretical mathematics to, uh, software and to bring those principles, particularly in terms of how one would classify abstractions and how one would organize abstractions in a software system."

[00:25:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, jeremy-siek, personal
"Jeremy, uh, yeah, he was just awesome. Um, so I met him at Notre Dame. I think it might have been his sophomore year. He took. The course in functional programming that I was teaching at the time, he was actually a math major, but he might have minored in computer science or, or was just taking computer science courses as well."

[00:28:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, community, diversity
"I can only remember meeting one woman, uh, in. All the different C++. Um, and well, pretty, the different boost meetings, boost focus meetings I've been to in the committee, there were sometimes more than one, but it was very small percentage, 2%, 3%."

[00:29:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, community, diversity
"So one reason I think, and, and this is I, I think an unfortunate aspect of our, um, the computer science and maybe the C++ community as well. Um, one of the reasons that, that women are, are so unrepresented."

[00:30:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, community, diversity
"And their hypothesis and their, uh, finding there, I think was that, uh, a lot of it had to do just with the vibe of the communities that there was maybe because of this, um, interest in trying to prove yourself to other programmers to make sure you know, this, this hubris aspect, to make sure that, uh, your code would be held in high regard, uh, sometimes did result in explicit competition and, uh, maybe, uh, not an environment that was really conducive to certain other ways of interacting and, and learning and, and, and promoting your work and some of those ways. Tend to be correlated, uh, with, with gender."

[00:39:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, libraries
"Um, when I arrived there, one of, um, it was actually through Boost, um, one of the authors of, uh, the Lambda Library, um, at the time, Jaakko Jarvi. And he ended up becoming the author of many, many things. Um, in C++ 11."

[00:40:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, cpp11, history
"Um, well, Lambda. Uh, very addict templates. Um, yeah, some very important things. And so when Iko finished and, and by that time I had started working in the, uh, you know, going to the C++ committee meetings and having some visibility in, in Boost and in that committee."

[00:42:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, doug-gregor, technical
"there are very few people like Doug. I mean, he was. Um, really able to grasp. Um, so I mentioned there's very few people who can kind of map all of those three paradigms of C++ and really, uh, apply them together and so forth. He, he would be one of those people."

[00:43:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, technical
"Uh, brilliant and highly productive programmer. So he wrote, um, a number of libraries for Boost, but also, um, contributed a number of things to C++ 11, uh, including concepts. So we had a proposal for C++ 11 to introduce concepts."

[00:44:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, technical, history
"And there were some language features that. We determined it would be really essential for doing that in C++. And one of them was this notion of concepts. Uh, this was an idea that Alex, um, had a developed, which is basically, uh, like a higher order kind of object or higher order type of class, which just described, uh, properties of a type."

[00:47:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, standardization, wg21, philosophy
"And so standardization really needs to emerge after, uh, there's a lot of experience with whatever's being standardized."

[00:48:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, standardization, wg21, philosophy
"And so I think that was one of the very, uh, important functions of Boost was it allowed not just libraries to be allowed programs, not just to kick the tires of libraries, but through these, um, mechanisms in templates where one could essentially extend the language. It also allowed people to, um. I'll play with new language features, I'll kick the tires on new language features."

[00:48:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, standardization, review-process, philosophy
"And so, uh, boost gave the, um, you know, the ability for other people to evaluate it, both in just being able to access the library, play with it, as well as through the peer review process. The, the thing about a standard is it's standards are forever."

[00:55:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, libraries, history
"So, uh, yeah, so the libraries that, uh, we, the Boost Libraries we ended up doing the lab were, um, boost Lambda that, uh, was Jaakko's thing. Um, MultiArray was, um, Ron Garcia, boost GR Library was, um, Jeremy and Rich Lee."

[00:58:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, funding
"Um, because of the, uh, support from the Lily endowment. Um, actually I'll say, uh, thanks to, uh, support we got from the National Science Foundation. Um, I was able to hire, uh, these students and, um, uh, hire these postdocs and it just was a, just like I said, a templates weren't an accident in, uh, C++."

[00:59:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, beman-dawes, dave-abrahams, community
"So Bevan das was kind of the, uh, progenitors, um, if you like, of, of Boost. Uh, Dave Abraham's is a very active, uh, person in both Boost and the, the C++ committee."

[01:01:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, generic-programming, history
"It also, I think, was hugely important in terms of propagating, uh, generic programming or template meta programming as a whole. So, um, because it really was one of the first real concentrated efforts in, uh, bringing generic programming to mainstream programming, because up to that point C++ was really all about objects and creating object hierarchies and inheritance and so forth, and."

[01:03:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, review-process, history
"Um, now of course in, uh, typical, uh, continuous integration and continuous development process, uh, particularly with Git, there's a, on GitHub, there's a step for doing review. Uh, that kind of process didn't really exist. Um, certainly in the open source community. And I think Boost was one of the first, um. Examples of, of this peer review process of open source software."

[01:04:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, review-process, history
"And so I think there might have been some, um, ideas or, uh, yeah, some ideas borrowed from the, the science typical research world of, of doing peer review to inequality."

[01:11:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, history
"One of the, uh, pieces that was left, of course, was concepts, uh, which were proposed for C++ 11, but I, I don't think concepts were quite around, uh, that virtuous circle of standardization that I mentioned. I think concepts, um. Yeah, just there, there wasn't enough experience with, uh, kicking the tires and really understanding how they could be used."

[01:11:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"And so when the com, the proposals, uh, were introduced to the committee, uh, there were actually originally two proposals. One from Texas A&M, from Bjarne's Group."

[01:11:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, decline
"boost when we were working on it in the early two thousands, uh, was a very special effort. Um, as it, it, like all good things kind of wound down. It sort of wound down for, uh, uh, several reasons."

[01:12:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, decline
"I think one was that a lot of the, I don't wanna call it low hanging fruit 'cause it wasn't easy, but a lot of the libraries that really addressed specific gaps in C++, both in terms of the libraries and languages, uh, did become part of C++ 11. So there were less obvious gaps to fill. In, uh, C++. And so there was less of a need for boost per se."

[01:12:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, history, decline
"Um, there was also, um, I think it, it might have been a victim of its own success in some ways. So, because, I mean, boost, uh, as it was evolving also, um, was interdependent. Libraries that were in Boost were dependent on other libraries that were in Boost. But as some of those libraries moved from Boost to becoming standardized, uh, the code that was dependent on the original libraries still stayed the same. People didn't go back. This would've been a huge effort to kind of go back and update all the libraries with the newly standardized things. So in some sense, boost was, yeah, as I mentioned, was kind of a victim of its own success."

[01:23:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"At one point we just decided it's time. Let's write a concept proposal for c plus standardization at the same time. Um, and there's some question about who proceeded who or who might have gotten the idea from whom, but about the same time, uh, Texas A&M, Bjarne and Gabby Dos Reis were also developing a proposal for concepts to go into C++ standardization."

[01:24:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"There were some fundamental incompatibilities between the two approaches. Particularly having to do, um, I believe with, um, conformance. So basically, how do you tell if a particular type meets the requirements of a concept? There were kind of two um, fields. One was nominal conformance, one was structural conformance, which, uh, basically means do you tell the compiler Yes, this conforms, does the compiler have to figure it out for itself?"

[01:25:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, stepanov, wg21, politics
"And so we, um, asked Alex, uh, stepping off to act as a referee. So we had a meeting, um. I don't remember where he was working at at the time. We want to say Adobe. So we went down to, um, Santa Clara had a meeting with um, or San Jose, had a, had a meeting with, um, Alex and, and all the principals from Indiana and Texas A&M and hashed out a compromise proposal at Adobe, uh, while we were at Adobe or the principles for compromise anyway."

[01:27:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, history
"Between that, what was your reaction? What was, how was the feeling between your crew? Oh, we were looking forward to, uh, well up to that point and, and somewhat beyond. We were really looking forward to it, kind of all that work. Finally paying off a concept, being part of the language, being able to write our own code with concepts somewhere."

[01:28:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"Between the first vote and the next vote. And this final vote was to take place, or did take place in the, the famous or infamous Frankfort meeting. Uh, Bjarne even has a paper. I, I think it's available online. Like what happened at the Frankfort meeting. Um, and the, you know, essentially Indiana and, uh, Texas A&M got cold feet about the compromise proposal."

[01:28:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"We really decided that, um, no, this feature we thought was important and we compromised on really was important and we can't compromise on it after all."

[01:29:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, politics, conflict
"And that that was actually Bjarne's preference, if I remember correctly. So we ended up, when they took the vote, the decision was to, um, take it out."

[01:29:56], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, personal, story
"Well, I got, I was so upset that I walked down the street from the conference center, walked down the street, went to a music store, and bought a guitar. That was my therapy."

[01:30:16], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, personal
"I don't remember what the first song I played on. It was, Uncomfortably Numb."

[01:31:30], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, wg21, history, decline
"So, um, I think some of it also, I think people felt a little burned out after I, I, and I'll speak that way for myself, maybe, uh, felt a little burned out, uh, with it, with all the effort, all the, uh, concentrated effort of developing concepts and, uh, just having it flame out like that."

[01:32:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, concepts, history, story
"But I think there's a great story about, you know, Alex's vision for it that, um, you know, there's this effort to really bring it to fruition, uh, because it was clearly a powerful way of, extremely powerful way of programming and organizing software. And then, and, you know, there's all this excitement, all this creation of stuff, the C++ 11 standard, and then kind of this, uh, I don't know if it was an Icarus, uh, kind of tragedy that they, you know, we flew to close to the sun and, uh, maybe that's the right analogy now that I think about it."

[01:33:00], Andrew Lumsdaine, boost, technical, philosophy
"You know, maybe that's what happened because part of what Boost was doing in terms of really, um, creating. And standardizing was, you know, I don't remember what the saying is, but you know, we do new things by going to the edge of what's possible and going a little further. Right? And so I think that's what Boost did in a lot of ways, was it went to the edge of what was possible in the language, and then went a little bit further. And I think in, you know, maybe the case of concepts, it was at the time, just a little bit too far."
