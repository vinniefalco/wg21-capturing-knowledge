## Transcript Start

[00:00:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So I have no idea.

[00:00:14] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Do you want me to clap?

[00:00:16] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I'm Howard Hinnant. Um, I'm retired from being a programmer for 20 or 30 years. Uh, before that I was a aerospace engineer and I have a terrible memory. I can't remember [00:00:30] the last part of that question. Boost, boost my, my connection to boost, um, Beman Dawes. I knew Beman Dawes from the, uh, C++ standards committee.

[00:00:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, um, I was, you could call me boost adjacent, I suppose. Uh, I, um, I wasn't. Involved a lot in Boost, but I did dabble in, in Boost, especially in the early years. Um, I guess the, uh, 20, the years, 2000, 2005, somewhere in there. [00:01:00] My best guess if I had a claim to fame, to Boost, and I really don't feel like I do would be the Chrono Library, but I didn't, uh, Chrono didn't start in Boost and I didn't put Chrono in Boost.

[00:01:12] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, I, I am the author of the Chrono Library along with Jeff Garland and several other people. Uh, we worked on it quite extensively, but we worked on it outside of Boost and, uh, for the purpose of standardization in, in C++, and, uh, [00:01:30] somebody else moved it into Boost with, with my permission. Good question.

[00:01:33] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, WG 21 is a nice short name for it. I often refer to it as the C++ standardization committee. Because hardly anybody will know what WG 21 is, is unless they are in WG 21. An engineer would be somebody who has been through more rigorous training, you know, maybe, uh, more informed about testing and about, uh, rigorous, more rigorous [00:02:00] design processes.

[00:02:01] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, probably has a stronger math background. Um, whereas coder might be somebody who, um, simply has picked up programming on their own. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I mostly picked up programming on my own myself. I, uh, had I think one or two courses of formal training and programming, uh, and neither of those were in C++.

[00:02:28] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And then programmer, I find it to be a [00:02:30] synonym with coder. Well, except coder might be a hobbyist, whereas Programmer might be more professional. Do you know you do it for a living? I think somebody that calls themselves, uh, a designer is probably better at laying out the high level design of, of a software project, uh, as opposed to the low level details.

[00:02:50] **HOWARD HINNANT:** High level design is a, a course, a critically important part of any programming project. Yeah, I would probably consider myself more of a low [00:03:00] level details guy. Low level details is like the foundation of a building. Uh, it's gotta be solid, it's gotta be strong. And, uh, if it's not the whole thing crumbles, I don't really see a lot of antagonist protagonist, uh, admittedly.

[00:03:15] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Perhaps that's because I haven't been intimately involved in reviewing code and, and all the detailed processes that go into getting a, a software project, uh, into Boost. And, and not only [00:03:30] into it, but maintained over the years. But, but I do know that the, the creation of Boost, uh, the way Beman envisioned it was as a software testing grounds for, uh, libraries to go into the C++ standards.

[00:03:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh, I think it's been very successful as that over the decades, Beman would be the protagonist, I guess. Um, he, he saw a need. We need, uh, libraries with field experience, uh, before they get standardized. 'cause standardizing [00:04:00] a library without field experience is a huge risk. You don't know whether it's gonna work, uh, you know, no matter how great it's designed and the programmers think it is, uh, when it hits the field, if nobody uses it.

[00:04:14] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Or nobody likes it. It's, it's not useful. And so having a place where people actually use the libraries before they get standardized and you get field experience and decide what works and what doesn't work through experimentation was a beaming, foresaw this [00:04:30] need. And I think creating Boost was the, uh, the way to solve the problem.

[00:04:39] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And I, I, and I think it was successful, I think the 2011, the 2011 standard incorporated a lot of things from Boost. And so that's approximately a decade after Boost was created. And it was the first major standard revision. Uh, there were, it wasn't the first [00:05:00] revision, the first, the original standard came out in 98.

[00:05:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, then that was revised in, in oh three. But that was considered a minor revision, more like a bug fix release. So the, the first major revision to the standard was 2011. And several Boost libraries were, were standardized at that time. And I think that's a point where you could say, this was worth it. This was a success.

[00:05:25] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I would say that the new problem is the old problem. We, we still need new [00:05:30] libraries. The, the C++ standard isn't complete. It, there's always more work to do. There's always another great library that could make, uh, the everyday programmers life more productive, easier, uh, less error prone, et cetera.

[00:05:46] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so I, I think that the original, uh, goals of Boost are still around today. Still useful today. Um, we still need testing ground for new libraries. Um, [00:06:00] and as far as I know that that is still happening and, uh, I think Boost is still a success. In continuing this mission? I don't know of anything, but admittedly, uh, I'm not aware of, uh, the more, I'm not as familiar with Boost, uh, post 2011.

[00:06:20] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So I, I can't think of a specific library or so that would fit the description that, that you're talking about. A, a library is good if lots of people use it. [00:06:30] If a, if, if a library does an amazing thing, whatever that thing is, but nobody uses it. There's no point in that library existing. Um, if people don't use a library, I would say it's, it's not really serving much of a purpose unless it's author created it for his own entertainment, which is, it's, which is not an unreasonable thing to do.

[00:06:51] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I am working on software that emulates, uh, integer arithmetic and floating point arithmetic and [00:07:00] rational arithmetic. I'm hoping to get to, uh, irrational arithmetic. I'm not sure if I can do it or not for me. Um, it's fun. It's, it's logical thinking that is, uh, educational. Um, I'm learning as a program, um, usually learning more about the subject that I'm programming, although I had learned more about programming itself as well.

[00:07:24] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh, when you don't have to, when you can program whatever you want and you don't have [00:07:30] deadlines that you have to meet, and when you get sick of working on it, you can throw, you can just walk away from it and stay away for however long you want. Uh, you know, a day, a week, a month, come back to it when you want.

[00:07:42] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's a fun hobby. It's good. No, it's not as fun, but it's still enjoyable work. Um, I started programming as a hobby, turned it into a profession. Uh, did, did fairly well at it. Did. And, and I enjoyed my work and I [00:08:00] am now retired and am enjoying my retirement and still programming. Oh, one hour. That's a difficult question that then you, and this, this person knows nothing about C++.

[00:08:10] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Correct. You start with a person who knows nothing about C++. Oh gosh. I, I think I would just show them how to print, how to print things out. 'cause once you, once you know how to print things out, uh, then you can, that's the simplest way to debug things. You know, you don't have to teach them about how the debugger works and all that.[00:08:30] 

[00:08:30] **HOWARD HINNANT:** If they can simply put something in and see something written out and maybe manipulate in between. For example, you, you take five and you take three and you input those numbers into your program and, and get out eight and say, okay, that there's addition. And so being able to print out the eight is, um, a, a way to get validation or a feedback from your program that it's working correct.

[00:08:55] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Or is not working correct. It, it's a, actually what I just said, it [00:09:00] is, you call it Hello World or you, you call it, it, it's traditionally called Hello World, and it's a program that does nothing but print out the string. Hello World. And it's the first exercise traditionally in every book. Um, because learning to print out is a very basic function, and that's all it's really doing is is teaching you how to print out a string.

[00:09:21] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I am sure it was literally hello world, you know, just printing out Hello world. Well, if we look at a bigger picture than C++, [00:09:30] software is very per pervasive in people's lives. It's, it's running your phone, it's running your car, um, it's running an amazing amount of, uh, the airplane you might fly on.

[00:09:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's in medical equipment. Um. It's, uh, in, in finance. All the banking stuff is done with, uh, with software. If you're into cryptocurrency, that's all software. And so software is everywhere these days and [00:10:00] software is written in in many different languages. Uh, there's c and C++. Python. Rust is an up and come up and coming programming language.

[00:10:10] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, but a lot of it is going to be written in C++. I'd hate to put a number on it. I don't think C++ is the most popular language, but it is a very strong language and it is popular. Um, and so it's highly likely that, um, most people on earth are interacting with C++ in [00:10:30] some way most days of their lives.

[00:10:32] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I'm sure there's a lot of C++ in your phone. For example, I would be surprised if Netflix isn't driven by a lot of C++ as well as some other languages too. I fell in love with C++ because. It could express very low level concepts in the language and in the same language also expressed very high level concepts.

[00:10:52] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so a high level concept might be, I don't know, you can, you can build types in C++, and so you might build a [00:11:00] type that represents a piece of fruit or a car or a person or um, whatever. Whereas a low level concept might be adding two integers or two floating point numbers or doing a division or, or doing ands between two bits of bits, two sets of bits.

[00:11:20] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Because I only had to learn the, the one language. Now at the time, I, I know a lot more. I, when I was younger, I knew a lot more languages. I've been, um, [00:11:30] programming in C++ exclusively for so long. I can't honestly say I know a lot of languages today, but at the, but when I was younger, I was experimenting with learning.

[00:11:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, different languages, Pascal and C and Assembly, et cetera, PostScript, even. Um, and I found that I could do, uh, so many things just using this one language, C++, and I found that very attractive. I grew up in Dallas, Texas. My father was a surgeon [00:12:00] and my mother was a, uh, a shopkeeper. What, what kind of, I'm sorry.

[00:12:04] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I couldn't hear you. What kind of young life did they give you? Oh, and I, I had a wonderful childhood with them. Um, I've got two older sisters. Um, I got a, uh, they made sure I got a very good education. Um, they also made sure that I got a very wide experience in life. Uh, we would do, uh, canoe trips, camping, camping, canoe [00:12:30] trips, snow skiing.

[00:12:32] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, we traveled. Uh, so I got a very well-rounded education as a young kid. I'm a late bloomer. I, um, when I was a senior in high school, I, for the first time learned what a program was. I had heard the word program before, but I didn't know what it was. And I bought a TI calculator, and at the time it was, it was a programmable, and I bought it because I wanted to find out what, what a [00:13:00] program was.

[00:13:01] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so that first bit of education taught me that a program was nothing but a memorized series of keystrokes on a calculator, which is of course is a great oversimplification, but it was a nice step in. So that was my first introduction to programming. Uh, but I wanted to be an aerospace engineer, and that's what I studied in college.

[00:13:25] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, went through bachelor's and master's and, uh, [00:13:30] worked for the government as an aerospace engineer for about a dozen years. 

[00:13:34] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** US Army. 

[00:13:35] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I worked for the US Army, uh, as a civilian, not as a a military person. Uh, we tried to keep, uh, helicopters from falling out of the sky. We didn't succeed. They still do fall out of the sky, but we did our best.

[00:13:49] **HOWARD HINNANT:** My specialty was, uh, rotorcraft dynamics, which means, uh, studying the vibrations of helicopters and other rotating objects. [00:14:00] And so we would, we would, uh, analyze, uh, systems both experimentally and through, uh, um, math called finite elements, uh, to determine things like natural ance frequencies and things like that.

[00:14:15] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And if you hit a resident frequency with a, if you drive a, a structure who, with the same frequency as its resident frequency, it tends to, uh, disassemble, uh, in an unpleasant [00:14:30] manner. Figuring out the problem was very satisfying. Knowing that, you know, I, no one knows, you know, doing this stuff if you really save a life.

[00:14:38] **HOWARD HINNANT:** But, um, I think it's safe to extrapolate that some of the work that I did, uh, probably did save some potential lives as I was, uh, while I was still working for the government, I got interested in, uh, I, we were using FORTRAN to, to do our analysis, and I got interested in exploring other [00:15:00] languages to, to do the analysis.

[00:15:02] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And I looked at c and I got very interested in C++ because of the ability to do the low, low level, high level, uh, abstraction and matrices are a very important, uh, aspect of doing finite element analysis. And, um, so I explored C++ quite a bit in programming matrices and, uh. Matrix arithmetic matrix, decomposition, [00:15:30] uh, and solutions.

[00:15:31] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so that got me more and more interested in, in the programming side of things and spec more specifically in C++. And, uh, in, let's see, in the fall of 1996, we had a government shutdown. And I decided that I wanted to see, uh, how the public sector worked. Maybe it worked better than, than working for the government.

[00:15:55] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I did very much like working for the government. Um, but [00:16:00] shutdowns are very demotivating for federal employees. Uh, it's true today, and it's was true back then, at least for me. And so I went to, for, uh, to work for a little company called Beam in Ithaca, New York. Uh, they were doing, uh, finite difference and finite element analysis, not just for structures, but for all kinds of problems.

[00:16:20] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, thermal structural. Um, even economics. Um, and so, uh, that was a, uh, that [00:16:30] was a good job. It didn't last long. From there I went to, uh, a little company called Metro Works that no longer exist. They were in Austin, Texas, and they built the code Warrior C++ compiler, and they hired me to take care of their standard library.

[00:16:48] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so that's how I got into the standardization process and C++ programming full-time and more or less left the engineering world [00:17:00] behind meeting, uh, meeting or at least seeing people that I had heard of and read about, uh, but never met and considered more or less, you know, uh, people. I was in awe of, uh, Bjarne Stroustrup, uh, Andrew Koenig.

[00:17:17] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh. It was like going for me, it was like going to a rock concert and seeing, you know, the, the rock stars. Let's see. I was living in Ithaca, New York at the time, and, uh, my first, uh, C++ standards meeting [00:17:30] was, uh, San Jose, California. And I walked in and, uh, saw people such as Bjarne and Andy [Koenig,] Bill Plougher, Beman Dawes.

[00:17:39] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's quite, it was, uh, quite thrilling for me. I attended the first meeting after C++ 98 came out. So that would've been, I think it was either the fall of 98 or the spring of 99. I don't remember for sure. I recall first hearing about it at a meeting. I don't remember which meeting. It might have been in that first one, but I suspect it [00:18:00] was probably a year or so later.

[00:18:02] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Hearing about what? 

[00:18:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Hearing about Boost, uh, from Beman Dawes. Um, he had an after hour session at one of the standards committees, committee meetings to, uh. Let people know about his project. And, uh, that's when I first heard about Boost. Uh, Beman was an expert in the, the library working group, uh, in the, within the C++ standards committee.

[00:18:25] **HOWARD HINNANT:** There's several different working groups. Uh, and at the time there was, [00:18:30] uh, the library group and the Evolution Group. And Beman was, um, uh, he wasn't the chair of it at the time, I don't think. Uh, but he had been the chair before I started attending. Um, and he was recognized expert, very well respected by everyone.

[00:18:50] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, I was thrilled to meet him and be mentored by him. Uh, and, uh, hearing about his boost project was, uh, [00:19:00] I thought very, very interesting. I was, uh, certainly I agreed with his premise that we needed someplace to field test, uh, C++ libraries before standardization. And this seemed ideal. Uh, and this was before places, things like GitHub, uh, was widely available of course.

[00:19:22] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so having, having all that infrastructure set up by boost for you, [00:19:30] made a good way to, uh, for some, for a nobody like me, to write a library and, and then put it in, in a place where people could see it and, and possibly use it. Well, I'm sure there was some of both of that. Um, and, uh, for me personally, uh, the, there was probably some of both of that.

[00:19:50] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, I, I thought it was a great idea, but of course I had no idea how how good it would work. You know, would it, would it pan [00:20:00] out? Would it produce great libraries? Would it fizzle? I didn't know at the time, I got interested in library called type traits, uh, around that time. And, uh, I, I think it was. Gosh, I, I'm not good with names.

[00:20:16] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Steve Cleary, possibly was the lead author on Type Traits, or John Maddock was probably involved too, so I don't, whoever was the lead author I'm sure is on the, uh, on the copyright notices of type traits. And I don't remember exactly who it is. [00:20:30] I'm, I'm sure your notes are correct. John Maddock was probably the, the lead author on Type Traits.

[00:20:36] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, and I got involved in that, uh, as a minor helper, uh, and uh, that, that eventually got standardized. And I was, uh, actively involved in helping that get standardized, uh, probably more on the, on the WG 21 side than the boost side. In the early days, we didn't have a well-defined process, and so the, [00:21:00] the process was, process was literally somebody would come up with a, with an idea and we'd discuss it online.

[00:21:07] **HOWARD HINNANT:** We'd try it in our own code, we'd make suggestions, give feedback. And so minor helper was I'd, I'd take some type traits and I'd, I'd use it and then say, I found this helpful and this not helpful. Or what about doing it this other way? Or, uh, that sort of thing. Making suggestions back that may or may not be [00:21:30] accepted.

[00:21:30] **HOWARD HINNANT:** By the time we got to standardizing it, um, we were looking at names and functionality and, you know, maybe tweaking some things, uh, from the way it was in boost, uh, to the way it is now in the standard. And that was usually based on a much broader, uh, field experience and, being a, uh. Being a library implementer for Metro Works, which was bought out by Motorola [00:22:00] and then turned split into Freescale.

[00:22:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, I had, I had a lot of, uh, visibility into field experience because I would get tons of customer feedback from my customers telling me something's broken here, or this didn't work the way I, I thought it should. Uh, and things like that. So I was in a position to, to really see and see the field experience and use it to improve things as it was being standardized.[00:22:30] 

[00:22:30] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's basically a, a static reflection of the, the language looking at itself. It can, it was a way to, uh, take, take types that you don't know anything about, say in generic programming templates, uh, and discover, uh, if there, if the type is an integer, if it's a floating point. If it's a class type and what properties it might have, like is it copy constructible later on?

[00:22:58] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Is it move Constructible? [00:23:00] Uh, once we got Move Semantics, is it assignable? Uh, if, does it have, uh, a base class? Uh, is it convertible from one type to another? That sort of thing. In generic programming, it's very useful because you might, you might have an algorithm, a generic algorithm that is, can be optimized one way for, one for types with one property and another way for types with another property.

[00:23:26] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And you might want to query that generic type and find out more [00:23:30] about it so that you know how, how better to optimize the, the generic code. Uh, move Semantics was being developed concurrently. I started working on move semantics in 2001. Uh, mainly in, in the context I was library implementer for Metro Works and Vector was too slow.

[00:23:48] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um. Vector is a, uh, basically just an array of objects, all the same object and in one memory allocation, and you, it's just [00:24:00] an array. You can index 'em. It's not a very exciting, uh, data structure, but it is the most useful data structure. And since it is so useful, everybody's using it and it needs to be fast.

[00:24:13] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And if it is not as fast or faster than everybody can make it for themselves, then nobody will use the standard version. The standard version has to be better than everybody else's, otherwise nobody's gonna want to use it. And so move semantics was a way [00:24:30] to make vector fast, faster, and along the way it makes a whole lot of other things faster too.

[00:24:36] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And the way it does that is by avoiding, uh, heap allocations and heap de allocations to this day. Uh, making, uh, heap allocations is one of the slower things you can do in C++. And in. Any language really is there. The only thing I can think of that made it come onto my radar was the fact that I was the library implementer and I was looking for ways to make my library better than the other guys.[00:25:00] 

[00:25:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, 'cause I a little bit competitive. Um, and so with Move semantics, I, you know, realized that for when you're doing something as basic as, uh, a pending something to a vector or inserting something into the middle of it, uh, you could avoid a lot of news and deletes that's memory allocations or, or heap allocations.

[00:25:22] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, and every time you avoid one, you make the program a little bit faster. And when you start, uh, [00:25:30] when you, when you start avoiding hundreds of them or thousands of them, you can make your program orders of magnitude faster. Uh, and so there was very strong motivation just for, from a performance standpoint to.

[00:25:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** To chase down, move semantics as hard as I could. And it, it took a decade to get it standardized. And, uh, I'm glad I didn't know that going into it. If I'd known how much work it would be to standardize it, I probably never would've started the effort. It's very difficult to get something standardized, and that is a [00:26:00] double-edged sword.

[00:26:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's both a good thing and a bad thing. Uh, it's bad of course, because it's hard to get something standardized. And if you, if you think you've got something great and you, you, you think you, it should be standardized. And if you know how hard it's gonna be, it might dissuade people from trying. On the other hand, everybody thinks they've got a great idea and not everybody does.

[00:26:22] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so there needs to be roadblocks to getting things standardized. Otherwise, garbage [00:26:30] accumulates in the standard and the standard degrades in quality. And so the bar should be very high to, to get a library or a language standardized. And, um. I, I was 20 years younger than I am now when I started that project.

[00:26:46] **HOWARD HINNANT:** 25, 25 years younger. And so I, I think the fact that I didn't know how hard it would be was an advantage to myself in that I could just, uh, sprint forward with it [00:27:00] and, and work on it for the love of working on it without worrying so much about how long it was going to take. So, move semantics, although it had a, a wide impact, call it a splash zone in the library, is essentially a language feature.

[00:27:16] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so Boost only handles libraries, and that's why it wasn't not even a consideration to put Move semantics as a language feature into Boost. Sure. Um, but it, but this language fe once you [00:27:30] have the feature in the language, all the libraries need to take advantage of it, and they don't do so automatically.

[00:27:36] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so there was a huge library c. To doing move semantics, modifying all the containers. And, you know, even, even IO was modified, uh, input output. It's a little complicated on boost because Boost has a long, uh, backwards compatibility tail. And so those authors who had [00:28:00] libraries prior to 2011, uh, were usually required or, or wanted to continue to support people who were still using C++ 98 or C++ oh three.

[00:28:14] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so if that's the case, uh, move semantics to something that would not be a tool available to them, or they might try to emulate it. There are ways you can emulate it. It's never as good as the real thing. Or you could, another possibility is you could look [00:28:30] at, uh. The macros and see if your compiler is, see if your library is being compiled under 2011 and only do move semantics if you're being compiled under 2011 or later.

[00:28:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so you might incorporate move semantics as an option that, uh, your code would suddenly get faster as it gets upgraded to a better C++, later C++ compiler. No, it's connected to me. It, it, it, I don't, I'm not terribly [00:29:00] familiar with boost, stop, move, but I believe it is a, uh, a move emulation that would sort of, sort of work in C++ 98 Oh.

[00:29:10] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Or, and oh three, our value reference probably. Um, okay. Um, so yes, I'm, I'm mentioned because I'm was the lead author on the Move Semantics proposal. Uh. But I wasn't active in putting the [00:29:30] move emulation into Boost. It's just flat out raw performance. It, there were some examples that I could make that, uh, made code 10 times faster, even a hundred times faster.

[00:29:44] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It didn't make all code that much faster. But there's, there are specific examples, you know, say inserting things into a vector, the inserting a vector of things into a vector. Uh, do, when you start playing those [00:30:00] kinds of games, um, move semantics made, could make orders of magnitude performance difference.

[00:30:06] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Sure. So before move semantics in C++ 98, we had a smart pointer called auto pointer. And Auto pointer was this wonderful thing that, uh, basically points to a, a heap allocated object. And its destruct, or when the auto pointer goes outta scope will automatically delete things for you. So that helps eliminate a class of problems [00:30:30] called memory leak so you don't have to explicitly free the memory, the library does it for you.

[00:30:36] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And Auto Pointer had unique ownership of this object, and that was a problem when you tried to copy the auto pointer. And in C++ 98 and oh three, there was no move. There was only copy. And so auto pointer had very strange copy semantics in that it would, uh, alt when usually when you copy something you don't modify the original.[00:31:00] 

[00:31:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** But when auto pointer copies something, it does modify the original. And that made it extremely difficult to use auto pointer in generic code, such as putting it into a vector. And in fact, it was so error prone to put auto pointer into, into a vector. Uh, a poison pill was designed into auto pointer. To reject being put into a vector at compile time, it would cause a compile time error.

[00:31:24] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, unfortunately that did not work for built-in arrays. You could still make built-in arrays of auto pointers and [00:31:30] that would still basically crash on you or cause the errors, memory errors they needed. One is a very basic low level tool. Uh, and so they, they just, they had to have one in nine in 98. So one of the things that, uh, you could do with move semantics, and this came out in the original proposal of move semantics, was that you could replace auto pointer with a another type of smart pointer that did the same job as auto pointer, [00:32:00] but with move you can alter the source without messing up generic code.

[00:32:06] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, when you copy, that's basically all a move is a move of an object is copying it, but. Uh, advertising and being given permission to alter the source object when you, when you copy it. And the, the theory on that is, is that you do this only in circumstances where, you know that source object is about to [00:32:30] be destroyed anyway.

[00:32:31] **HOWARD HINNANT:** You don't care about its value. And so unique Pointer is an auto pointer that simply moves instead of copies, and it in fact refuses to copy it, compile time, because it cannot leave its source object unchanged. And so if you try to copy it, it's a compile time error. So, unique Pointer was actually part of the, uh, original move proposal at the, although at that time it was named Move Pointer instead of Unique Pointer.

[00:32:57] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, I decided Move Pointer was a terrible name [00:33:00] for it, and Unique Pointer was a better name. Uh, and I, I'm the one that came up with Move, move Pointer in the first place. So I'm blaming myself for that terrible original name. Uh, and that goes back to field experience. When you first write a library, you don't really, you're not always sure how well it's gonna work in real life until you start using it a lot.

[00:33:22] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so it was over the course of several years that I decided Move Pointer was bad name. So at any rate, um, [00:33:30] that's how Unique Pointer came to be. And it eventually replaced Auto Pointer. We deprecated auto Pointer and eventually removed it from the standard after many years. Yeah, because of its unusual semantics and copying.

[00:33:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It was, it was quite error prone. It, it did some things very well. Um, it just didn't copy well. And the answer, instead of making it copy better was to have it refuse to copy, but still be able to transfer ownership of the value from one place of the program to another, [00:34:00] such as returning it from a function.

[00:34:02] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, this was before I, I started attending, uh, 98 or whatever. Right. Um. And so I, I, I think I've heard some of those stories, but it, not, not enough times and not well enough to, to be able to recount them. But in your world, I, I don't remember who, uh, came up with Auto Pointer, but it, it might've been a few of the people you just mentioned.

[00:34:28] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh,[00:34:30] 

[00:34:31] **HOWARD HINNANT:** but, uh, I do, I do recall that Peter Dimov came up with Shared Pointer and, uh, popularized it through Boost. So it got a lot of field experience at that time. Everybody and their dog was riding their own shared pointer and, uh, including myself, uh, because it's such a useful tool, like Auto Pointer was very useful even though it was flawed that you always need one, uh, [00:35:00] in, in a programming project of any size, you need some way to share ownership.

[00:35:04] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, from several different places in your program of a heap allocated object. And Peter Dimov came up with a shared pointer that was just better than everybody else's. It was harder for it to, uh, to have errors with runtime errors. It could do more things than everybody else's shared pointer. It was just bulletproof.

[00:35:26] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, and over the, over the [00:35:30] course of, I'm sure what must have been several years of field testing in Boost, uh, Peter Dimov made it from better than everybody else's to even better than that. Um, it just became better and better. And it was a shoe in for standardization in 2011. Um, I, I not sure, but I think we may have taken that one without any, any changes at all.

[00:35:56] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, besides wordsmithing, uh, Peter [00:36:00] Dimov is one of the, is the only person I can think of. Has succeeded in standardizing things without ever showing up to a meeting. By the way, I have no clue because I could not do it. Uh, if I want something standardized, I have to, I have to go there year after year and argue with people, then try to convince 'em that I'm right.

[00:36:19] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh, and about half the times I tried to do that, I did not succeed. Uh, so it's, uh, it's difficult to get something standardized when you [00:36:30] do attend the meetings and not just one, but regularly. 

[00:36:34] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Have you ever met Peter? 

[00:36:35] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I have never met him, but I've talked with him many times on email. I would love to see him in this documentary.

[00:36:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Yeah. Peter, if you're out there, please, please, uh, come on. However you Yeah. Uh, some, some people might consider Peter Dimov a mysterious figure. I, I don't, and I, I may not be [00:37:00] unique in that. Um, and that's, maybe that's because of the, the nature of the way I grew up in, in the C++ industry. Um, ever since Metro works in 90, 98, I think, um, I've been working remotely, uh, out of my home office mostly, most of that time in Ithaca, New York.

[00:37:26] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so I became very accustomed to working with people [00:37:30] without ever meeting them. And so Peter wasn't really an exception for me. I never met Peter because for the same reason, I never met most of the people I worked with. Uh, some people, you know, I would see at a meeting, a, a standards meeting or a C++ conference, but not everybody, you know, a minority of the people that I would work with over email.

[00:37:52] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I might meet at a standards meeting. Even, uh, even people within my own, uh, [00:38:00] you know, other people employed by the same company I'm working for a lot of them. I might meet once a year at a company meeting or something like that, but otherwise never meet them. And even, even more, maybe some of their colleagues also in the company I might never meet at all, uh, but might still occasionally work with them.

[00:38:18] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so I, I didn't find Peter mysterious and maybe that was, that's the reason as it just was normal for me to not meet everybody. So I'm trying to remember the first time I went to [00:38:30] a non, to a C++ meeting, which wasn't a standards meeting. Uh, my first standards meeting was in 98, I think. Um, my first non-standard C++ meeting, that might have been a BoostCon.

[00:38:44] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And if you say it started in 2007, I believe you, uh, my, uh, memory of dates is certainly flawed. It was held in, uh, Aspen, Colorado, I believe. Uh, very nice venue. Uh, they eventually outgrew that venue, but not for [00:39:00] many years, I believe. But, uh, I attended, so I did not put Chrono into Boost. I, uh, Jeff Garland and I were, uh, working on standardizing thread.

[00:39:13] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, and well actually, uh, more than just Jeff Garland and I, uh, several of us were working on standardizing thread. Jeff Garland was part of the team, and Jeff Garland is author of the Boost DateTime library. So of course I got together with Jeff and I [00:39:30] say we need to take a subset of the Boost DateTime library.

[00:39:35] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Just enough to support threading for doing things like, uh, sleeping or, uh, timed wait on a mu tex. So it, we didn't want the whole boost package. I mean, when I say we, I don't mean me and I don't mean Jeff. I mean the committee, uh, standardizing thread was very, uh, difficult 'cause a lot of people disagree, you know, had disagreements about how to, how [00:40:00] it should be done and standardizing the timing part of it was equally difficult.

[00:40:05] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so I was essentially giving, given, uh, marching orders, uh, to standardize the bare minimum on timing services, just to support thread. No calendar, no calendaring services, no leap seconds, uh, just the bare minimum we needed. Units, uh, duration units [00:40:30] and possibly duration time points. Um, so Jeff and I were working on that basically from the library working group.

[00:40:38] **HOWARD HINNANT:** There was a, a, not an individual, but a consensus among the attendees at the library working group in the, which is a subgroup of the standards committee. That that was what, that was all they were going to accept. And so why, probably because we did not have sufficient field experience to know what we were doing.

[00:40:59] **HOWARD HINNANT:** You [00:41:00] know, the boost date time library did have a lot of field experience and there was a boost threading library that had some, but not as much. But we did alter the boost library fairly significantly, uh, on standardization. And so that brought the field experience on, on that down to zero, uh, which is risky.

[00:41:22] **HOWARD HINNANT:** We felt it was best, but still, um, there's a risk there. And so the, the majority of the, the [00:41:30] LWG [ Library Working Group], uh, really did not want to, uh, standardize something and regret it later. Uh, it's much easier to add things later, rather, and it's very difficult to take things outta the standard. Absolutely. Very risk adverse.

[00:41:46] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, it's a, it's an in international standard, you know, it's going to commit millions or more dollars from various companies around the world in supporting this language and in using the [00:42:00] language, uh, in many projects, some of which may be, uh, may have safety concerns. So, uh. Standardizing something is not something one should do lightly.

[00:42:15] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So Jeff, Jeff and I were tasked with getting the bare minimum of Boost DateTime standardized to support threading. And as we were working on that, I realized that the duration units could be, uh, related through templates, [00:42:30] through generic programming instead of through inheritance, which is a form of run runtime polymorphism.

[00:42:36] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, and that's really the, where Krono was born, it was of course, strongly, uh, molded by, by Jeff's state work and date time. Uh, but it was just a different approach to, to having the units interop interoperate with each other. And so that's, that was way too big of a change that would've been a, a giant breaking change for [00:43:00] boost.

[00:43:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So we, we couldn't have, we couldn't just modify date time. So it became its own library. Uh. Beman wanted to put it in a nested namespace because Nested namespace had gotten good field experience with, with boost. And so we searched and searched and came up with the name Chrono, to, to put it in. And that became the name of the library and the, the name of the nested namespace.

[00:43:23] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And we standardized, uh, just durations and time points and, uh, a couple of clocks. A few [00:43:30] clocks. And that was enough to support, uh, all the, all of the timing, API that we needed for threading. Chrono is a, uh, a, a library that helps programmers deal with time. Uh, in a nutshell, it has, since, since 2011, it has, uh, been greatly expanded.

[00:43:54] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, it now deals with calendars and time zones and all sorts of things, [00:44:00] even leap seconds. But in 2011, it basically just dealt with hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds, units of time. So the, the library working group has evolved over the, over the decades. Um, I was chair of it from 2005 to 2010, and at that time, the library working group was in charge of all libraries, um, going into the standard, [00:44:30] be it from boost or from other submitters.

[00:44:33] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And the, the process for doing that would be to, uh, people would write proposals and we would review those proposals and usually recommend changes or decline the proposal altogether, and eventually accept a proposal or an amended proposal. Uh, since, uh, that time the library working group has been split into multiple working groups, [00:45:00] uh, there is now a library evolution working group that does the, the job of selecting proposals and approving them or not.

[00:45:10] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And the, the library working group without evolution is mainly responsible for getting the wording right, the specification in the standard. In other words, making sure the, the specification in the standard does exactly, uh, says exactly what the library is supposed to do is [00:45:30] unambiguous. So that without giving implementation, anybody can, you know, different vendors can take that specification and write software and all the different people who do that, their software should behave the same.

[00:45:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** The software, the specification has to be precise enough that. You given the same inputs, you always get the same output no matter who wrote the library. I think there's also now a third library group called, I don't even remember what it's called. I, it's looking at [00:46:00] proposal. It's even ahead of library evolution.

[00:46:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It's looking at proposals and trying to make sure they're, uh, in good enough shape to present to library evolution incubation, I think they call it. Oh, okay. I would say it's a very democratic process. Um, the, the chair is responsible for, uh, mundane tasks such as, uh, deciding which paper's going to get discussed and when, um, processing issues, which are basically [00:46:30] bug reports against the, the standard and maintaining.

[00:46:34] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Maintaining order and keeping things moving and, you know, in the process. Uh, but the chair is not in a position to decide what gets standardized and what doesn't. That's done by all the, all the people that attend the, the session. And usually it's not just a simple majority, but uh, what we would call a consensus.

[00:46:57] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, meaning not [00:47:00] just the majority, but more than the majority feels that something should be put in the standard. It's never unanimous, but two thirds would be a, you know, a rule of thumb that, you know, you need at least two thirds to, to put something in the standard. The convener has. No influence at all over, uh, the library proposals.

[00:47:24] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, he's responsible for running the meeting as a whole. Um, and by meeting, [00:47:30] I mean the, the C++ standards meeting. So, you know, the, when the meeting starts, all the subgroups meet together and the convener will lead that, uh, discussion. And it usually, that is a non-technical discussion and involves administra, you know, administrative issues such as Herb Sutter's a great guy.

[00:47:53] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, I like Herb a lot. And he is been convener for I don't know how long, maybe 20 years. [00:48:00] Um, we are just in the process of, uh, changing conveners. Herb is stepping down. Um, I believe it's Guy Davidson is the new convener. Um, but Herb, personally, terrific guy. Um. And a good guy to ask for advice on how to run meetings that are as large as the C++ meeting is on the library side.

[00:48:27] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Bjarne rarely intervenes. I'm, I'm not [00:48:30] sure I, I can't think of an example where Bjarne has, uh, weighed in on libraries. He mainly attends evolution, uh, which is the language part of, of the standards process. And he, he has, uh, influence in that. He, of course, is the inventor of C++. So people, uh, greatly respect his opinion, but it's not like he gets more votes than anybody else.

[00:48:55] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, everybody still gets one vote and including Bjarne gets [00:49:00] one vote. And so, uh, sometimes he's in the majority and sometimes he's not. I was selected by whom? I'm not really sure. I, uh, I, the chair before me was Matt Austern. And he probably had a say in it though. I, I don't really know Herb, actually, I don't know if Herb was convener at that time.

[00:49:18] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Whoever was convener probably had a say in it. And, uh, Beman probably had a say in it as well. I, but I, I don't actually know who said what about it. Uh, I [00:49:30] was in, I was asked to be chair and I accepted because I don't know if this is still a convention, but when I was, when I became chair in 2005, Beman told me this is a five year term.

[00:49:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** You, you need to give it up after five years. And so I, I honored that and I don't know if there's still following that procedure or not. I am, I'm biased. Of course it is. I, I look back fondly on my period of, uh, being chair of the LWG and I'm, I'm proud of the work that we put in and I think, uh, [00:50:00] we, we've.

[00:50:01] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Did a lot of great things. Uh, we got a lot of good library standardized. I'm also proud of the language side with move semantics. Even though, uh, as chair of the LWG had to go to the EWG, the evolution group to, to push the Move Semantics, some of some of those libraries, uh, such as Unique Pointer [Ptr] didn't come from Boost, but, uh, came outside the Boost process.

[00:50:25] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, Chrono also came outside the Boost process, even though there is [00:50:30] a chrono library. It, let's see. During my, during my time, I believe we standardized Shared Pointer, I think Regex, uh, um, the Unordered containers, which are Hash containers. Um, don't actually remember if the Hash containers came from Boost or not.

[00:50:48] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Yeah. Uh, at the time all the vendors had shipped. Their own hash containers Okay. As extensions to the standard. And [00:51:00] so, but somewhere in there, there would've been a proposal to standardize hash containers. And I don't remember who the author of that was. Yeah. Uh, Daniel James may have well been the, uh, author of the proposal.

[00:51:12] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I don't recall. But that is certainly knowable information. All the papers are still publicly available, back decades when I believe variant in an MPL came after 2011 Atomic. That came in 2011. We got Atomics in 2011. [00:51:30] Um, I don't recall if it came from Boost or not. Um, I'm not really, I don't, I don't follow Boost close enough to recognize that there has been a decline in, in productivity, if you will, uh, and getting libraries submitted.

[00:51:47] **HOWARD HINNANT:** To are accepted into the standard. Uh, there may well be, I'm just ignorant of whether that is true or not. Um, but it is. I also do know that for the, for the [00:52:00] 2011 standard, I feel that Boost was very influential. They got multiple libraries in, I don't know, don't recall exactly how many, but, uh, certainly I would, I would say that Boost was a giant success for the 2011 standard.

[00:52:17] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And probably one of the reasons, uh, that it was as we got such a large volume standardized was that there's, there was an extremely long time between standards [00:52:30] between 2003, 2011, that's what, uh, eight years. Um. These days we're, we're putting out a standard every three years. And so it is, uh, if, if you don't get a proposal in, in the beginning of that three year period, you're, you've already missed that ship.

[00:52:51] **HOWARD HINNANT:** You're, you're gonna go into the next standard because it, from proposal submittal, time to acceptance, it, it takes a long time [00:53:00] to get something standardized. Uh, you've gotta argue first that it's worthy of standardization and convince a, a majority, a super majority, that this is something that needs to be in the standard and will be used by a, a lot of people.

[00:53:14] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, and that it's high enough quality and, uh, it's portably implementable. And then there's the process of, uh, writing down what the library is supposed to do in precise enough language that multiple people or [00:53:30] multiple companies can go out and implement it and have it be the same library. The, the wording alone takes quite a bit of effort and, and quite a bit of time to get right.

[00:53:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I would say that is certainly a valid theory. I don't know whether it's true or not, but yes, that is, that is very quite possible. It, it, it is quite possible that because we had such a long, uh, period between 2003 and 2011 standards, that the [00:54:00] reason so many libraries were standardized boost libraries were standardized in 2011 is simply because there was eight years instead of the three between standards that we have now.

[00:54:09] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So, um, while I was at Freescale, um, it, it seemed to me that Freescale was, uh, moving away from C++ and, and the standardization process, um, more than I was comfortable with. They still have a C++ product. They still have Code Warriors, [00:54:30] so they, they haven't departed the scene, but I. Started looking around and, uh, I was offered a job at Apple as their, uh, C++ library implementer.

[00:54:42] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So it was a, just like at Freescale, I was a team of one, I was the only guy working on it at Apple. I was also a team of one, the only guy working on their standard library. And so that's what I did at, uh, at Apple for seven years was support, uh, you know, write [00:55:00] and support their standard library and represent Apple's interest on the C++ standards Committee companies certainly have, uh, an influence, um, on, on the standards committee, if they attend the standards committee, if they have representatives there.

[00:55:15] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, boost also has an influence, even though it's not a company. Uh, I would think mainly because Boost has a, a history of producing very high quality libraries that [00:55:30] have gone through a very rigorous review process. To become part of Boost. Uh, you can't just ship anything off to Boost and say, here, I want this to be part of Boost.

[00:55:40] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And they, they don't just take it. There's a, you know, very rigorous process. Um, I've, I'm not familiar myself with getting libraries into Boost, but I would not be surprised if somebody told me that it's just as hard to get a librarian to boost as it is to get one standardized. There's a high bar there as [00:56:00] well.

[00:56:00] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so that is, that is known and the standards committee knows that, that knows this fact. And so the standards committee is inclined to, uh, look favorably on, on Boost libraries. Of course, the standard committee doesn't really, uh, pick libraries, the standards committee fields proposals. And so somebody has to write that proposal to, to get a Boost Library [00:56:30] standardized.

[00:56:31] **HOWARD HINNANT:** The, the effort to standardize concepts for the, for the 2011 standard was probably something of a saga. Now, I don't know the details of it because as library working group chair, I was just very concentrated on libraries and did not have any time at all to, to look elsewhere. And concepts is a language feature, and so it would've been discussed in the evolution working group [ EWG / LEWG].

[00:56:59] **HOWARD HINNANT:** But [00:57:00] you, you hear things through the walls and, and stuff like that. And, and so I know that there was a, uh, a huge effort to standardize concepts and a consensus could not be formed on exactly. What that language feature was going to look like. Uh, I believe there were two camps and I, I don't remember the individuals in each camp who they were, and I don't remember what the different models were that the two camps wanted.

[00:57:27] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I simply know that they failed to reach a [00:57:30] consensus, and the result was, is that nothing in that department got standardized In 2011. The, the sides were, uh, large. There, there was a big debate over cancellation in threading. And cancellation is where one thread tells another thread to stop. Uh, just whatever you're doing, just stop doing it and kill yourself without bringing the whole program down.

[00:57:52] **HOWARD HINNANT:** C++ threads were based largely on what's called P threads, which is part of the PSIC standard. Thus the p and [00:58:00] p threads and P threads has cancellation in. But in PSIC threads, cancellation is more of an order and less of a request, but that's not workable in C++ because, uh, you have to have destruct, you have to have arbitrary code run after you receive a cancellation, um, destructs have to run else.

[00:58:21] **HOWARD HINNANT:** You get memory leaks. And memory leaks are completely unacceptable. So if one were to cancel a thread and [00:58:30] that, and if when you did that, the thread stopped instantly, then you would have memory leaks all over, all over the place, and your program would eventually, you know, stop running if you did that enough times.

[00:58:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So one camp believed that cancellation meant as it does in P threads, that the thread had to stop instantly. The other camp believed that cancellation should not be an order to stop, but a request to stop. You need to let the [00:59:00] thread know that its services are no longer needed and to wrap things up when, when it, as soon as it could.

[00:59:06] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And that way that thread could say, okay, well I need to run a bunch of destructs and free all my memory and, and then I can quit, or something, something like that. And somehow, um, it seemed to me that that was never communicated strongly enough or appropriately enough, or clear enough that we were able to reach a consensus.

[00:59:29] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so [00:59:30] cancellation was, was taken out of the proposals for, for 2011. I think it may have gotten back in, in 2020. I'm not sure. I would have to look that up. But at any rate, I, I personally thought that was, uh, that was a poor move that we made. 2011 threads less good than they could have been because we removed this, this feature of them.

[00:59:55] **HOWARD HINNANT:** They're not of the cancellation part, but, but standard threads were [01:00:00] strongly influenced by boost threads. Um, some changes were made on the, on the way in, uh, not only to boost threads, but uh, other things like, uh, boost Locks and Mutexes. And I think there was a Boost Condition Variable at the time. I don't remember for sure.

[01:00:18] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, I don't think I, and I could be wrong, that Boost didn't have a cancellation at the time, but I don't recall. So we, the, I was on the camp that wanted [01:00:30] cancellation. And so one of the problems we had was that we didn't have a lot of field experience with it, uh, as written in C++. Of course, there was a lot of field experience with P Thread's cancellation.

[01:00:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, but boost, certainly, uh, I would say that that is an example of a Boost library being standardized, even though it got tweaked on the way in. Um, in 2010, I, uh, gave the not, I gave, uh, I ended my chair and [01:01:00] Alistair Meredith became the next chair. It's not really the chair's, um, authority to choose the next chair.

[01:01:06] **HOWARD HINNANT:** That's more the convener's role. The chair might be consulted. Uh, great guy. He had been attending C++ standards, uh, for, for quite a while. Uh, he's the author of the Standard Array Library. Um, I believe he's the one that finally, uh. Took auto pointer out of the standard, um, a after I [01:01:30] became chair, um, I mean after I, after I was chair in, in 2010 and later I, I still attended library, working group.

[01:01:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, but I was much more, uh, relaxed about it and, um, you know, didn't attend every meeting as I, as I would have during chair. You know, I might have skipped a, a meeting here and there. That didn't bother me at all. Uh, five, [01:02:00] the, the reason five years was a, uh, a good suggestion for the term of seat, uh, library chair is because it's a position that at least in my experience, will burn you out.

[01:02:13] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And it did. And so I was, I was thrilled to give Alistair or anyone the, the chair in, in 2010 or starting in 2011. Uh, and I was not disappointed at all that I was not [01:02:30] chair when the 2011 standard was shipped. I was thrilled that the 2011 standard was shipped because we had been working on it for so long, uh, since 2003.

[01:02:43] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, and I was very excited to see a lot of my personal pet projects go in, such as Move Semantics, Unique Pointer, Chrono, I don't know about everybody else. Uh, I posted on Stack Overflow and got in trouble for it. Uh, not serious trouble. I'm, I'm making a somewhat [01:03:00] of a joke. Um, I posted on Stack Overflow.

[01:03:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Hey, guess what? Everybody, we just voted for the C++, you know, 11 standard, it just passed. Um, and other o other commenters on the, uh, on Stack Overflow had, uh, some problems with how I stated this and that it wasn't really a question or I don't really know what other people did to celebrate. But I went back to my ho hotel room and I was a, just [01:03:30] newly, a newly minted member of Stack Overflow.

[01:03:32] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, I'd just joined. And so I posted on Stack Overflow and, and I think I, I, on Stack Overflow, you have to pose it a question and then you can answer it. And so I, I think I asked the question, when, when will the next C++ C++ standard come out? And then I answered myself and I said, tonight, we just voted it in.

[01:03:53] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh, there were, there were some people who didn't believe me and. And there were others that, you [01:04:00] know, saying, well, why are you doing this? And I, I, I think I literally said, this is, this is how I celebrate it. And, uh, then there, there were other people who had some complaints. And so I thought what I said, what I thought was a funny joke being as it took us eight years to get this standard out.

[01:04:18] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I said, I promise not to do this again for a very long time. I got a few laughs out of it. My personal opinion is that C++ 11 is a very, uh, had a very big impact on the [01:04:30] industry. I, the attendance at the standards meetings started going up. Um, and I think that's a reflection of usage in the language going up.

[01:04:40] **HOWARD HINNANT:** C++ had had gotten very old. And I think C++ 11 brought in enough new features, both in the language, in the library, that it, uh, very much invigorated, reinvigorated, um. The language as a whole, you know, as a product, as a tool to, [01:05:00] to make things. Uh, and then we also started starting in 2011.

[01:05:05] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, Herb [Sutter] made the decision to put out a standard every three years and then instead of waiting for features to be done, anything that was done in in the three year time period would ship those things that were still in progress would simply keep, be, still be worked on, but possibly be shipped in the next standard. And, and so with that, I feel like we have [01:05:30] maintained, uh, an excitement and the size of the committee has continued to grow. And although I have no way to back this up, my impression is that the usage in the field of C++ is still strong and possibly growing. In 2014, I moved from Apple to a little bitty company called Ripple.

[01:05:51] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I think we had about 40. Employees at the time. And, uh, ripple is a, a cryptocurrency, and they're, they're, [01:06:00] uh, their reason for being is to make it cheaper and easier to make payments, especially cross border, uh, international payments, uh, right now, um, that is done through, uh, a company called Swift. And if you're going from one economic, uh, network to another, it can take days for the, for the transaction to settle.

[01:06:24] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, um, the fees are relatively high. And Ripple's goal is to make, [01:06:30] uh, moving currency around the world is fast and easy as the internet makes moving information around the world, uh, do it for, for fractions of a penny and instantaneously or within a few seconds. That's the vision. And, uh, ripple is still working on that, uh, and doing, I would say, making good progress.

[01:06:52] **HOWARD HINNANT:** But there's still a lot of work to do, and I, I worked with Ripple from 2014 to just last year to, [01:07:00] which was 2024 and I am now retired. I don't know if you can point to any one person. Uh, it started as a group of just a handful of people. Um, let's see. I'm most familiar with David Schwartz. That is who I worked with for many years at Ripple.

[01:07:20] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so he was certainly one of the originating founders and visionary. In fact, um, regularly the company would restate its vision because it [01:07:30] was growing very fast. Um, and so the, the company vision was restated practically at every meeting to make sure that every employee, even the, all the new ones coming in, uh, were familiar with it.

[01:07:44] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I was brought in as their C++ expert. Um, the, the product. That I was working on, which was the XRP network was made almost exclusively out of c from C++ written and C++. [01:08:00] And so they brought me in to make sure that they were using C++ correctly and efficiently. And, uh, as my knowledge of the language and libraries of, of course, is, uh, very strong, who you call, I was recruited by Vinnie Falco, who, uh, no longer is with Ripple, uh, is now, uh, running the C++ Alliance organization.

[01:08:24] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, Vinnie Falco was a, was the, uh, the manager [01:08:30] on the XRP network, uh, team. Vinnie Falco first called me probably late in 2013 and asked me if I'd be interested in, in working for, for Ripple. Uh, I. I don't remember for sure, but I probably told him at the time that I was only, I was not interested in relocating and only available for remote work.

[01:08:54] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And he told me that would not be a problem. And I suddenly became very interested. [01:09:00] And so, uh, after some interviews and I went out to, uh, San Francisco to, to see the company for myself and a lot of soul searching, I, uh, decided it was a good move for me. Uh, Vinnie is very outgoing, um, not afraid to say what he thinks I would say enthusiastic about everything he's doing.

[01:09:19] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, he never go, he never does anything Halfway did a lot of soul searching and decided that, uh, you know, I was nervous about jumping from a huge company like Apple to a little 40 [01:09:30] person company like Ripple. Uh, but I decided to, uh, to take the risk and I'm extremely glad that I did. Uh, ripple was very good to me for the over 10 years I worked there.

[01:09:42] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh. I thoroughly enjoyed working for Ripple. It's an outstanding company and, um, I, I think Ripple is going to change the world. So Vinnie is very, a very prolific, prolific programmer and [01:10:00] very good at it. Um, and he was working on his own utilities library called Beast. And Beast started, uh, basically just as a, a part of the XRP network, a, a li a library that the network used.

[01:10:15] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And, uh, after, after Vinnie left Ripple, Beast evolved into a Boost Library. From what I understand, I did not follow that adoption closely, but I believe Beast is now part of Boost. I will [01:10:30] attempt to, uh, I may not remember everything. XRP is a digital currency, much like, uh, Bitcoin, but different in some important ways.

[01:10:40] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Bitcoin takes a huge amount of energy, as you've probably heard in the news for each transaction and takes a relatively long time to do it. Not days but minutes. I don't know the exact number. XRP takes almost no energy at all compared to boost. It's extremely energy [01:11:00] efficient. I mean, I'm compared to Bitcoin.

[01:11:03] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Start that sentence again. Sure. Uh, XRP is extremely energy efficient compared to Bitcoin. Um, and in that sense it's, I think it's one of the biggest selling points of XRP. It's, it is the green, uh, digital currency. It does not pollute the earth, uh, by any stretch of the imagination and actually runs faster than, than, uh, Bitcoin does.

[01:11:28] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So it's, uh, it's [01:11:30] efficient, it's fast. It's a, it's a great digital currency. It Ripple is a company. That is not in control of XRP, but is using XRP to actually do things besides just being an investment vehicle. Uh, they're, they're using XRP to transfer money across the globe, essentially to be the underpinnings of a financial network.

[01:11:56] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So Beast inside [01:12:00] of, uh, in, at the time it was inside of Ripple, it was a utility library, uh, and that, that the XRP network used. And I don't recall exactly all of the utilities that it did, but it would've done things like, um, uh, produce hash codes or um, uh, encrypt things and decrypt things. Um, uh, possibly logging.

[01:12:28] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I'm, I may [01:12:30] be guilty of confusing. There were also, we also had utilities outside of the Beast Library. Hmm. Uh, so I, it's possible I might be confusing when, when Vinnie watches this, he might recognize, uh, some utilities that says, no, that wasn't part of Beast, and, or that was, but uh, but it's that sort of thing.

[01:12:48] **HOWARD HINNANT:** It was a low level, low level things that weren't directly related to the finances, but still needed to be done. House cleaning chores. You know, uh, when I came aboard Ripple, uh, [01:13:00] Vinny was the manage was managing the, uh, the leader of the XRP network team. Um, David was on that team. Uh, my understanding was that he had no interest in, uh, running the team, you know, managing the people and, and doing the administrative work.

[01:13:17] **HOWARD HINNANT:** He was more interested in doing the technical work, which I can relate to. I much prefer technical work, uh, to management work myself. As far as I know, he was, uh, regarded [01:13:30] well, uh, re respected. Well, uh, I will preface. My statement with the fact that for Ripple, I was a remote employee, and so I was not at the water cooler, so to speak, uh, you know, day to day in the office.

[01:13:45] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Actually, I think it was an email. And so, uh, I, and I, uh, the, the first I heard of Vinnie, uh, he contacted me by email and I believe we communicated by email until I came, uh, to the office in person [01:14:00] for my in-person interview. And prior to that, I had never heard of any Falco, uh, or Ripple for that matter.

[01:14:07] **HOWARD HINNANT:** When I went for my in-person interview at Ripple, uh, it was some nondescript building in New York, New York City, I'm sorry, San Francisco. When I first went to my in-person interview at Ripple, uh, the building was nondescript building in San Francisco. I don't remember seeing a, even a sign outside that said Ripple.

[01:14:29] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, [01:14:30] I had an address to. To go to. And I went to that address and there was, there was a building and it, at the time, it really wasn't, it wasn't a fancy building or anything special. It was obviously a, a very young company just getting on its feet. Uh, they didn't even have health insurance. I, I, uh, we got health insurance through, uh, the Cobra system, uh, from a previous employee that didn't last long, that was only for, I don't know, six months or whatever.

[01:14:59] **HOWARD HINNANT:** [01:15:00] But the company was that young. It was, they, they were still getting on their feet. And I, uh, I was lucky to get on, on what they call the ground floor. As I arrived at the building, I, uh, alerted the, uh, front desk that I was there, and, uh, Vinnie came to the front desk and uh, and that's the first time we met and shook hands and started to get to know each other.

[01:15:23] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, I would say Vinnie recruited me specifically. Uh, I don't know if I would've called it aggressive or [01:15:30] not. Yeah, I, I had not been shopping for a job. Uh, and, uh, he, he came specifically to me. I, I, I didn't go to Ripple for a job of all the C++ greats out there. Why, why do you, what do you think Vinnie saw in you?

[01:15:46] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I, I'm sure Vinnie has very good instincts about folks. I learned a lot while working at Ripple. I knew nothing about digital currency, uh, when I started there. And after 10 years, um, I know a lot more, [01:16:00] but I feel like I, I still feel like I know nothing about digital currency even after 10 years and working on the network.

[01:16:06] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Um, but I, uh, I, I certainly know a lot more about it now than I did 10 years ago or 11 years ago. And I, uh, also worked on some very interesting projects that, uh, that I didn't know how to do. And I taught myself how to do them, uh, low, low level things like, uh, I wrote a floating point, emulation. [01:16:30] Uh, which I am now building off of as a hobby, uh, which, so I really enjoyed that work and, uh, learned a lot while I was doing it.

[01:16:38] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I was at a standards meeting in Kona, Hawaii, uh, with, uh, one other Ripple employee when we learned that Vinnie had quit, uh, left the company and we were shocked. Uh, we, we did not see it coming. We did not know what that would mean for us. We don't know. We didn't know why he [01:17:00] left. Uh, to this day, I really don't know the details of why he left.

[01:17:05] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I still, I continued working for, for Ripple after that and, and still continued to enjoy the job. I think it was probably personal communications between myself and, and Vinnie over email as, uh, af after he, he left Ripple. We, we continued to, uh, not talk a lot, but periodically, uh, question might go back and forth.

[01:17:29] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I [01:17:30] think Vinnie discussed, uh, starting these. I don't know that I would say he discussed starting it with me. Maybe the proper thing is to say Vinnie, uh, let me know that he had started the C++ Alliance and, uh, and what its purpose was and directed me to its website and, you know, just show showing me around.

[01:17:52] **HOWARD HINNANT:** As always, Vinnie seemed very enthusiastic about the C++ Alliance. I've never known Vinnie to not be [01:18:00] enthusiastic about what he's working on, but to support C++ as well as I remember. Although it has been quite a while since that conversation, I did not, I did not follow, uh, beast getting standardized into Boost.

[01:18:13] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, and, uh, and I haven't really followed, uh, the inner workings of, of Boost in the last five or 10 years, uh, very closely. I had heard that that C++ Alliance [01:18:30] had started, uh, supporting Boost, be it, become the, the foundation behind it. Um, I, I heard it. I don't know really anything about it except that it happened and, uh, and that Vinnie is the head of the CC++ Alliance as far as I know.

[01:18:51] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, boost is going to continue to, to be a value to the C++ community as a testing ground for [01:19:00] C++ libraries. Um, I have noted that the Boost website has gotten a complete makeover from what it used to be. Um, and, but I haven't explored it thoroughly, but, um, it's got a fresh face. I, I don't know if there's new functionality in there or not, just because I haven't explored it enough, but, um, it, it seems to me like Boost is alive and well.

[01:19:23] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I don't know the details because I'm one, I'm not a lawyer. And two, even, even more important, I don't want [01:19:30] to be a lawyer. I don't enjoy dealing with license issues. I do know that the Boost, uh, the people in Boost the organization as a whole worked very hard on crafting their license. If I'm not mistaken.

[01:19:44] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I believe they even hired a lawyer to help them do so. I'm not sure what the problems were with the other open source licenses that, uh, motivated Boost to, to create their own. Uh, there's also the MIT Open source [01:20:00] license, the BSD Open Source license, and several others, I can't remember. Um, and each one of them had evidently some obstacle to, to boost adopting it or, or using it as its own.

[01:20:16] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so they created their own and I. All I know is that they're very happy with it. They wish everybody would use it even for projects outside of Boost. Um, and that [01:20:30] if you want a project to go into Boost, it has to be copyrighted under the Boost license. Uh, I, I don't know the details of why that's true.

[01:20:41] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I just know that they, they will not accept an MIT or a BSD open license. I, I deal with licenses so rarely. And so, uh, I, when I write my own projects, I just slap the MIT license on there and, and don't give it a second thought. I think people are proud of their work [01:21:00] and, and would like to see their name in, you know, in the copyright.

[01:21:04] **HOWARD HINNANT:** I don't, I don't have visibility enough into, uh, a wider audience to know that a lot of programmers are satisfied or dissatisfied with. Getting their name on the copyright. I do know that normally when you work for a private company that is developing software that is not open source, it is not common to have your name included in the license.

[01:21:29] **HOWARD HINNANT:** [01:21:30] That's when you work for a company and write software. It's the company software, not your own. And I believe for the boost license that there is an attribution that people do get their name in the copyright. Uh, if I'm wrong about that, then it's changed. Uh, because it, it, it used to be that way, you know, 20 years ago or 25 years ago, not no company that I've ever worked for that I know of ever uses code that they don't know where it comes from [01:22:00] because companies are paranoid about stepping into legal landmines. A lot of companies refuse to use, uh, any open software source software at all. And. Another bunch of companies will only use Boost software, um, as, as open source, as well as their own internal software, of course. And the reason they make an exception for Boost Software is because of its reputation for high quality.

[01:22:28] **HOWARD HINNANT:** Uh, the, [01:22:30] the, the cost of the legal issue, the, the quality of the library that benefit outweighs the cost of the legal issues for the lawyers. I think the reason I say that is because on so many Stack Overflow questions I see people will say, uh, you know, if I, if I offer them, say my library to, to solve a problem, uh, I often get responses like, sorry, but I have to use only Boost.

[01:22:54] **HOWARD HINNANT:** So that speaks highly of Boost Libraries. As far as I know, it's the attribution is really only visible [01:23:00] for open source source software. And for open source software, I think it is the norm That attribution is used for software that is not open source. It, it never sees the light of day outside of an individual company.

[01:23:13] **HOWARD HINNANT:** And so I don't think it's really important that there be attribution there because the only reason a programmer like myself might want their name on a piece of software is so that they can point to it publicly and say, I did [01:23:30] that. That's my work. And you can't point publicly to, uh, a company owned private software piece of software.
