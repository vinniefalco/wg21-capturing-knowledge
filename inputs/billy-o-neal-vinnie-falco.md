@Vinnie [6:39]: You're telling me you're telling me stories of which this is that's one of the reasons I wanna talk to you, but before we do that, I wanna tell you

@Billy O'Neal [6:44]: Yeah Older

@Vinnie [6:47]: What?

@Billy O'Neal [6:48]: So you want me to repeat that now that this is turned on?

@Vinnie [6:49]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't have to, we don't have to cater to the machine. The machine caters to us. We just talk and we, we just act properly.

@Billy O'Neal [6:56]: Sure. But, but we didn't give the machine that context. Like I can't fault the LM for not having information that I didn't give it.

@Vinnie [7:03]: I want to hear the stories, but before we do that, I want to tell you my story. So my story is very long and it started when I was like 22 and I got a, I think it was one of those. What was that machine that was like the cow was, I think it was, was it Dell? Did Dell start with like a cow?

@Billy O'Neal [7:07]: OK. I thought it was Gateway was the couch.

@Vinnie [7:19]: Gateway, that's the one. I had that, I had a stupid machine and like, you know, if the evolution of Windows and it was all cool and I was programming all that time, and for almost all of that time, I viewed the the downloading and the installation of like external libraries is a massive pain in my back end, right? And then, and then no, but, but then I got VC package and I was like, man, something's something's got to give because I need openness. I need

@Billy O'Neal [7:21]: Yes yes

@Billy O'Neal [7:40]: And it remains so.

@Vinnie [7:49]: OpenSSL reliably. I need Zib reliably, and you know what, I got it to work and now I have so many things. I have wolf SSL, Open SSL, Zib, broccoli, you know, I got my brotli in there. I got like some other stuff and it's been very, very handy, and I like it because now I can, you know, I can build like that tower of abstraction of libraries depending on libraries.

@Billy O'Neal [8:04]: Mhm OK. Yes Yeah, it, it, I'm, I'm very happy to hear that you're happy, the usual thing is everybody, the, the usual thing that's painful in the space is everybody thinks of themselves at the top of the pyramid.

@Billy O'Neal [8:26]: And nobody thinks about, well, what if you're a piece of the pyramid and there are things that depend on you. So, so like I had somebody compla complain to us the other day saying like, well, why do this package management exist? Like you should just copy your dependencies in like submodules and we're like, that works until 2 people do this

@Vinnie [8:32]: Oh, right, yeah. Oh my god Some modules all, you know, every, every once in a while I get like this urge to use submodules. I'm like, oh this could solve my problem. I regret it later.

@Billy O'Neal [8:55]: No, like, some modules are fine. It's just like as a, like people don't think about if 5 different people have their own Zib submodule at different versions that you've created a link disaster, right? Like that's just a scenario that people who aren't in the dependency management space don't think about because it's not their table, I guess.

@Vinnie [9:18]: Fair But I feel like it can AI?

@Billy O'Neal [9:21]: And where they come from like node world where like EquaScript solves this problem by just letting you load a whole bunch of mutually incompatible versions of things and that works. Sorry, I interrupted. Go ahead

@Vinnie [9:36]: No, no, no, please OK, fold it, full disclosure. I wanna give you the full disclosure. Like I said, you know, I've been huffing the AI juice, and, and you know I have issues with the committee.

@Billy O'Neal [9:42]: Mhm. Mhm Does anybody not have issues with the committee? like

@Vinnie [9:52]: And my my my intellectual framework for understanding WG 21 is called Great Founder Theory.

@Billy O'Neal [9:58]: Mhm

@Vinnie [10:00]: And it's a manuscript by Samo Burha. It's called Great Founder's Theory, and it's very intellectual and it basically says that functional institutions are the exception. You're right, and like all, all institutions fail, and if they don't solve what's called the succession problem. In other words, how do you appoint like the next leader? Then they usually, they usually suffer institutional entropy, right? So, what I find is I find that

@Billy O'Neal [10:03]: OK That's fair

@Vinnie [10:26]: The great founder theory analysis of like people in these types of bureaucracies, it explains everything, and one of the things that it that it is explaining is this concept that's called tacit knowledge. That means when you have a bunch of people in the domain and like they know things, but it's not recorded. Like for example in WG 21 you have outcomes and you have decisions that are recorded but not the why, not the rationale, not like the reason, right?

@Billy O'Neal [10:33]: Mhm

@Billy O'Neal [10:52]: Yeah, and ISSO rules prevent us from recording it, which is annoying as hell, but

@Vinnie [10:56]: Yes, however, however, in my quest to be rather than being rather than being critical, I've, I'm trying to be constructive. I'm getting, I'm getting guidance from like my CEO. He's like,

@Billy O'Neal [11:06]: That's fair.

@Vinnie [11:07]: Yes, so I've been, I've invented a process. It's called knowledge capture, and the way that it works, the way that it works is you, I just interview someone or anyone can interview anyone and you get a transcript and then what I do is like I have, I have like this whole little agentic framework that like it extracts the bits of knowledge from that person about like the problem domain, right? And, and I've been using that on people. Like I've, I've interviewed some people and, you know, in WG 21 and

@Billy O'Neal [11:12]: OK

@Billy O'Neal [11:29]: Mhm

@Vinnie [11:37]: And and like an outside that, and I've taken those transcripts and then I've run the knowledge capture, right? And it's super duper interesting, like, like this is very, very interesting. Let me see if I can find like Howard Hinnan.

@Billy O'Neal [11:39]: Mhm.

@Vinnie [11:50]: OK, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna share the link from Howard like if you.

@Billy O'Neal [11:53]: Yeah, I just got in an argument to the, the other day about why does Chrono accept everything by Contra?

@Vinnie [11:59]: Well, I mean, I don't know

@Billy O'Neal [12:00]: Because Because, you know, and my reply was, well, because Howard said he wanted it to do big numbs or something someday. And then somebody asked, and then somebody said, well, do you have like a reference for that. And while I found the paper from 2008 where they're talking about being representation agnostic, but in their example paper, they passed by value. So clearly that's not why.

@Vinnie [12:09]: I, you know, So So, so check out, I just gave you a link. I want, I want you to check out the, I did an interview on Howard for 2 hours, and I did like the knowledge capture. So check out like that file, you see that link?

@Billy O'Neal [12:28]: Oh

@Vinnie [12:35]: It's in the, it's in the chat for the huddle.

@Billy O'Neal [12:38]: Oh, for the huddle, crap.

@Vinnie [12:40]: Yeah, I know it's lame, slack eye.

@Billy O'Neal [12:42]: There it is. OK. I was looking in the our our personal messages.

@Vinnie [12:46]: So this is the knowledge capture. And if you just, you know, if you go down to P1, look at P1, that's his first principle.

@Billy O'Neal [12:58]: Make the impossible possible, not the easy easier.

@Vinnie [12:58]: And this has to do. Only standardized features that enable what was previously impossible or impractical. So like this is, this is knowledge that I captured from Howard, right? And then I've done, I've done this with like lots and lots of people, and I've built up this little knowledge base and then what's interesting is once you have that, you can do, you can do like another processing step where you find out like what did all these people have in common? like what do they say that's in common, right? And then you like you distill that and then what you can do is whenever you have knowledge like in the domain.

@Billy O'Neal [13:10]: Mhm.

@Vinnie [13:31]: You can create what I call an evaluation framework. So if you, whenever you have a domain who's like inputs and outputs are papers. You can create an evaluation framework to evaluate the documentation that that process produces, right? OK, so like

@Billy O'Neal [13:44]: Mhm

@Vinnie [13:47]: I did that, I created this thing called a paper tester.

@Billy O'Neal [13:51]: OK

@Vinnie [13:53]: Let me see if I can find it. Oh yeah, OK, so you should check it out. So I made a paper tester. I synthesized this using AI from all of these interviews. And I've got a warrant, Billy, I have to warn you. I got to warn you, this is, this is not real. You got to understand that this, I mean, this is just my opinions, my influence. This is, I mean, to do this right, it would requires collaboration of experts.

@Billy O'Neal [14:14]: Mhm

@Vinnie [14:20]: So this is just a demo of what's possible. Don't take this as any kind of like

@Billy O'Neal [14:23]: Oh no.

@Vinnie [14:25]: Don't take this as, you know, like any kind of like truth. It's just an example to to give you an idea and like to stimulate your imagination, but you see, you see the paper tester?

@Billy O'Neal [14:29]: Uh-huh Yeah, I'm just trying to follow your, your slack keeps trying to copy a link to the chat message, including the link. I'm like, no, I want the link out of the chat message. OK.

@Vinnie [14:45]: OK.

@Billy O'Neal [14:45]: Slack. Anyway,

@Vinnie [14:48]: So you see, you see the paper tester?

@Billy O'Neal [14:51]: Yes

@Vinnie [14:52]: OK, so it's long, obviously, you're not, don't, you don't have to read it, but, but it helped, it identifies papers and like it has a gate, so paper gets automatically rejected unless it has like certain things like a justification, some kind of field experience, right? OK, so now I know, I know what you're thinking to yourself, right? You're like, Vinny, but so what papers have you run this on? it's funny that it's funny that it's funny that you mentioned.

@Billy O'Neal [14:54]: Mhm Mhm

@Billy O'Neal [15:12]: Well Yes, I'm assuming.

@Vinnie [15:16]: So here I've got, I, there's a link. I just give you a link. So there's a folder tell me, tell me one of these papers so I can look at it with you and like you click on the one that you think is interesting and then then you tell me what you think of the result.

@Billy O'Neal [15:27]: I see. it is unfortunate that I have been not, like, since I left the library's team in Early 2020. I have, I have not looked at much committee stuff like I occasionally pay attention on the LWG reflector and point stuff out, but.

@Vinnie [15:44]: This is for entertain this is for entertainment only you're selection is not like just.

@Billy O'Neal [15:47]: Sure. I understand.

@Vinnie [15:49]: Just pick one.

@Billy O'Neal [15:51]: Yeah, let's do Cindy. OK, I'm looking at Cindy

@Vinnie [15:54]: 7D, OK That's it. There you go.

@Billy O'Neal [16:03]: Yeah, retrospective commitment, what the heck is that?

@Vinnie [16:04]: Just Look for the colors Look for the colors

@Billy O'Neal [16:11]: Sure. Yeah, well, and I, and I use that, I picked that example because of the first blank you had which was make the impossible possible, not the easy, easier for the, for the age, for ages, I've always wished for.

@Vinnie [16:18]: Yes.

@Billy O'Neal [16:24]: A practical way you could writeinD without descending into every particular vendor's intrinsics, and.

@Vinnie [16:29]: Or after the call or after Peter Diemoff to help me.

@Billy O'Neal [16:32]: Well No, but I mean like if you only care about one platform, Cindy is not that annoying. It's Like I always wanted to do like a better UTF conversion with SIMD, for example, in the standard library, and I couldn't ever justify doing it because I wasn't able to do it all 5 times.

@Vinnie [16:53]: Oh, for each of the different versions.

@Billy O'Neal [16:56]: For each of the different, yeah, the CPUs. So like you'd have to write a different version for X86 and X64 and arm, especially arm, like Intel has a great intrinsics. Lookup reference tool thing arm does not. So, like, if you wanted to write the equivalent thing in arm, it was like, I don't know,

@Vinnie [17:17]: So scar.

@Billy O'Neal [17:17]: And especially UTF conversion like You're programming the shuffle unit and there's no good like straight line code you would write that you would expect the optimizer to turn into calling programming the shuffle unit. So, Anyway,

@Vinnie [17:32]: So you look at the, look at the paper, you see there's like a table and it has like check marks and all that.

@Billy O'Neal [17:37]: Yeah

@Vinnie [17:38]: So that, that's like the output and then there's some more like there's some more slop afterwards that like explains like the why. So that's, that's just an example, and I find this, this is, I think this is really cool. OK, so where does this, how do you fit into all this? So I wanna, I wanna run the, I wanna run the knowledge capture on you. And so the way that we do that is you just tell me like awesome cool stories, like, you know, yeah, like cool stories about either in the compiling or the VC packaging.

@Billy O'Neal [17:44]: Sure. OK OK

@Billy O'Neal [18:04]: Sure. Well, I, I guess I will say I guess I would put it, well, the two ways. There's a, there's definitely a split between when I was doing committee stuff and now, I can tell you about when I was doing committee stuff, if you think that would be more helpful for this project, or if you want more VC package related stuff. I just know that

@Vinnie [18:23]: I like hearing about I like hearing about what's it like in the trenches? Like you're maintaining, you're maintaining code, get down into the technical level, like, you know, like this, like this happened.

@Billy O'Neal [18:28]: OK Well, I have trench stories for either one, but,

@Vinnie [18:35]: I look re stories are great failures, stories about failures are ironically more helpful than successes.

@Billy O'Neal [18:41]: OK. I'll, I'll pick, I'll pick one of, I'll go into one of each then, I guess. So, I mean When I, when I was doing committee stuff, I viewed my role on the committee as mostly trying to block things that are unimplementable on Windows. so And also I guess the whole reason why I left the libraries team and joined DC Package was the networking TS because I saw

@Billy O'Neal [19:07]: The networking PS as effectively unimplementable. Like the networking TI and I, I use that because I know you have a history with ASIO and, and, and Chris and stuff, Because Like ASIO has a long history, but ASIO has a long history where they broke ABI every 6 months. And I saw no practical future where I could make an ABI stabilized.

@Billy O'Neal [19:33]: ASIO, like, you said failures. What was it? Boyer Mo Searcher.

@Vinnie [19:40]: So ABI ABI stability failures are great. I'd love to hear it.

@Billy O'Neal [19:44]: Yes. Boyer More Searcher. So Boost has this library that Marshall Clough wrote that Uses unordered map to to implement Boyer More on, you know, what arbitrary string you put into it. And then Lis C++ found that they could not shift Marshall Cloud's reference implementation because the standard put Poyer More searcher in the functional header.

@Billy O'Neal [20:10]: And Unordered map Needs to include functional because that's where stood Hash lives And now they've created this heterocircularity problem. So, like, even though they had a reference implementation that they could say worked, because he her shenanigans, it was, live C++ was one of the was we shipped it before Lip C++ did, even though they had the original implementation. because getting it out of their experimental header and into the real header, the real functional header exposed the circularity.

@Billy O'Neal [20:45]: But like The failure here is I'm in our implementation, I made a mistake in detecting when we could use the table lookup instead of the unordered map lookup. And the boost version implemented that fix, like,

@Billy O'Neal [21:05]: I don't know, a month after we shipped ours, but because Boost breaks API every 6 months, and we don't Like, we're basically stuck with that, with that suboptimal implementation for the foreseeable future. so like even that, that is a

@Billy O'Neal [21:21]: Basic implement this algorithm from the 70s or maybe 80s, and it, and the paper came with reference implementation, which is usually my big bugbear with libraries, papers. It's like, if this is a pure library extension, you should have An implementation. It should not be wishful thinking.

@Billy O'Neal [21:41]: And So I saw that and went, well, Like, This plan of try to put everything into stood. Which is a thing that I wanted for ages because of the ABI requirements, I just don't think it could ever happen. Like, the networking ETS

@Billy O'Neal [22:00]: I see no, I do not think it is responsible to put networking in the standard without TLS and I don't know of any TLS implementation that will ever meet stood ABI requirements.

@Vinnie [22:11]: If I could interject, I just want to let you know for the record, I'm not attached to the networking TS.

@Billy O'Neal [22:13]: Mhm.

@Vinnie [22:18]: I mean, I was then to some extent, I just feel like C++ has been held behind because there's no vocabulary for networking, right? And because, because of, you know, the package issues and C++ unique situation has made it difficult. So I feel like

@Billy O'Neal [22:19]: Sure Yes

@Vinnie [22:35]: By the way, I, and I agree with what you're saying. The ABI is a problem. Like that's a real issue, you know what I mean? so it's very difficult to balance like all these competing needs. So tell me, tell me more, tell me why it maybe I, why is ABI stability important? What is the problem that's being solved there?

@Billy O'Neal [22:38]: Mhm. Yes. Well, Well, Well, I guess that's part of the thing is like for our implementation we broke ADI every because

@Vinnie [22:51]: I

@Billy O'Neal [22:57]: Windows as a platform was designed to allow ABI instability, like applications normally come with all of their dependencies, like install DLLs in the system and they all party on each other is not the expected. Outcome. But that is the case on like Mac OS and Linux. So like for us, if we want to break ABI, all we have to do is bump the version number in the DLL.

@Billy O'Neal [23:21]: And as long as everybody In like that closed, in that link domain bumps the version, then they can get the new baby eye and it's fine. but we heard feedback from like especially enterprise customers that updating their compiler all at the same time is painful for them.

@Billy O'Neal [23:40]: And, you know, when we ship Visual Studio every 3 to 5 years, Maybe that was a lot more reasonable, but now we ship Visual Studio like every month. So, like, break ABI every month would, would have been excessive. I personally feel that like 5 or 10 years in that range is probably a reasonable lifespan for an ABI for us, but I acknowledge that like that break is much, much, much easier on Windows than it is on the other platforms because because we have like

@Billy O'Neal [24:12]: In dynamic linking cases, HDLL is an island. So like you can have one process with 5 different CRTs in it on Windows and Not only is that expected, that's normally what happens. Like NTDL.dol has its own C on time, and the operating system has its own C run time and usually each application comes with their own sea run time.

@Billy O'Neal [24:34]: Which You know, sucks cause we have multiple copies of things, but it's great in that you could get brand new C++20 features back on Windows XP because you're not stuck with whatever Windows XP shipped with. So anyway, Yeah, so AI stability, it matters, but I don't see a path where TLS is implementable and the networkingTS, I use that example because that was a big motivating reason why it changed teams to join VC package. Like I tried to do the networking TS when I don't think I can ever ship this, so

@Billy O'Neal [25:08]: Like, I want to get you real ASIO, not Out of date ASIO 3 months after I ship it. Oh, that's, and that's the example, like, I implemented the Boyermo Searcher paper, and then my implementation that I shift is worse than what you can get from Boost, like less than a year.

@Billy O'Neal [25:30]: After shipping it. And so, like, it doesn't matter that it's in stood. Like, It's important to get people the things that actually solve the problems because there's a whole universe of problems that have good solutions that won't necessarily meet the requirements to be understood, like, your GPGPU programming library like Thrust, doesn't need to fit on a pick.

@Billy O'Neal [25:58]: But, you know, the court, the The advantage of being understood is that it's everywhere and the corollary corollary of that is everything you put in stood has to be able to go everywhere. And that, that kind of creates a whole mess. And of course ASIO, like the, the vocabulary types problem like you said. The problem is that ASync frameworks don't com async doesn't compose.

@Billy O'Neal [26:24]: And it's hard to get through standardization because in the vacuum of vocabulary types, to talk about async. Everybody has come up with their own model like ASIO If you squint, looks like IO completion ports.

@Vinnie [26:39]: Yeah, it does, it does, it does, and, and, and having done an implementation of IO completion ports and also EPOL. The IO completion ports are nice.

@Billy O'Neal [26:49]: Yes, and, well, and you see, I mean, like BSD to Khus and know Linux has done IOU ring, so like I think the platforms have kind of converged on something that looks pretty close to IOCP, but like The point is that concurrency thought process is only about IO concurrency.

@Billy O'Neal [27:09]: Like it works great with one thread and you're waiting for the network the whole time. And it's not the solution for like what the parallel algorithms are trying to do. And I still haven't seen Evidence that we as an industry have a straight solution for

@Billy O'Neal [27:27]: Marrying those two, cause they kind of want Opposite. They kind of have competing goals, like,

@Vinnie [27:32]: Wait a minute, stop right there. OK, I want to understand this. So here, so Billy O'Neill at 3:59 p.m. we're talking about his implementation experience. So here's, let me, I'm going to tell you what I heard and you tell me if that's accurate. So what you've identified is you've identified two different domains that are both related because they involve concurrency. One is the IO domain which includes like networking, but it can include asynchronous file IO, serial ports, and that sort of thing. And then the other one is you have this concept of parallel computing. It might even be he

@Billy O'Neal [27:36]: Mhm Sure. Mhm

@Vinnie [28:02]: Ter o gen ous computing, and you've identified, you've identified that they have different needs despite having the thing in common, which is concurrency. Can you expand on that, please?

@Billy O'Neal [28:04]: Yes Sure.

@Vinnie [28:14]: I don't know anything about parallel algorithms. So if you could teach me, just tell me like what is it all about? I see it in CUV reference. I see this like this par, and I, but I never know what it is, what is it?

@Billy O'Neal [28:17]: Right. So Like Sure. So, like They are like different, I don't know, if you, if you were drawing the domain of this problems faced with a square and like the problems on one axis go one way and the problems the other axis go to the other. So, like the problems the networkingTS and similar concurrency models like LibUV and IO completion ports and friends look like they're trying to solve is, I have a small amount of compute resources, or I have like one thread.

@Billy O'Neal [28:57]: And the majority of what I am doing is waiting for IO to happen, and I want to not block the CPU that I have waiting for that IO to happen. So like, I want to issue like disk controller, go over there and go do this work for me and then come back.

@Billy O'Neal [29:13]: The And I should be specific about cause the, the, these people argue about what peril, the word paraelism and the word concurrency mean. so Parallel and by parallel in this case I mean parallel algorithms, not

@Billy O'Neal [29:31]: Just what the standard calls parallel. I'm, I'm sorry. is, I'm not waiting IO on IO at all. I am only doing this pure computational problem, and it only lives inside CPU land, and it never touches the system. Like the idea of like writing to a file from parallel for each.

@Billy O'Neal [29:51]: Is kind of a broken idea, like it's not built to do that problem. like you can, but it will, the implementation will be poor. Whereas the equivalent thing with ASIO, you would have one thread that issues however many like file right calls and you're not needing to burn a whole bunch of physical threads, to do that.

@Billy O'Neal [30:18]: I think if I squint, I have not followed it very closely, that the executor's thing is like The first attempt that I have seen to try to marry these universes because they're really solving like

@Billy O'Neal [30:34]: I'm waiting on IO versus I'm waiting on the CPU. And there is a Potential meshing here of, well, you could see that block of parallellyzed CPU work as like its iO if you squint.

@Vinnie [30:51]: Tell me more, tell me more about that. OK, so, so let, so let the record show, so you're you're identifying the possibility that there might be a more a general abstraction that's capable of representing both of these domains.

@Billy O'Neal [30:56]: Uh-huh I imagine that's such an abstraction is possible. I do not see that we as an industry have

@Billy O'Neal [31:14]: Landed on what that answer is.

@Vinnie [31:17]: Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this, as a, as a scientist, because as engineers we're all scientists. We form a hypothesis, in other words, that I can write code this way to do something. Then we test our hypothesis, we implement it, and then we run it. We look at the results and then, and then we iterate. That's the scientific method, but it's, you know, code is the output. As a scientist, if you wanted the hypothesis of that there is that there exists, I want to find a model that works for both. What would you, as Billy O'Neill, as a principal

@Vinnie [31:47]: Researcher, how, what would be your methodology for exploring that? How would you try to discover that interface?

@Billy O'Neal [31:51]: Oh That's hard, right? Because The thing that's, it's not hard to build a model that can model the things. What's hard is, can you build a model that models all of the things that people can practically use. so, like,

@Vinnie [32:09]: Hm

@Billy O'Neal [32:12]: I want, I, let me explain my if you squint. A little bit So If you imagine the different CPUs in your system as like IO. So like I, I'm gonna, I don't know, I'm gonna just, like I have an array with a 1000 numbers in it, and I want to do some computation that's expensive, and I'm going to give half the numbers to CPU 1.5 the numbers to CPU 2.

@Billy O'Neal [32:37]: Well CP1 could model the communication with CPU2 as IO. Like Go submit a work item to CPU2. That to from CP1's perspective, that looks like a file right.

@Billy O'Neal [32:54]: Or talking to the network or whatever, like CP1 doesn't care anymore. CP1 goes and does its half of the computation, and then when it's done it can go check. Hey, are you done CPU2? But like,

@Billy O'Neal [33:10]: And that's like the bit that can mesh together, like you could model I did this parallel computation. As like a file right. And lots of parallelism models do this, like the one thread that people understand and then you do like, oh pragma OMP parallel in there.

@Billy O'Neal [33:34]: All right. And there are all kinds of problems with that. But like, for better or worse, that's what we have seen that people are able to practically use, and That sounds bad to me as like I guess the sum of that is I am scared to touch anything with that with standardization because no attempt to mesh these together has seen broad adoption.

@Billy O'Neal [34:02]: To prove that it works.

@Vinnie [34:04]: Fair

@Billy O'Neal [34:06]: So like, Task-based currency. Which is a thing that people thought was going to be the new hotness forever. Well, we tried that. We built concurrency run time, which is before my time, long before my time, but

@Billy O'Neal [34:25]: It, it has, you know, like you have something that looks like a tad, like a future, to use the standard languages future. And you can the reasonfuture. then didn't get added into the standard was argument about where it does the dot then run and all of that jazz. Well,

@Vinnie [34:41]: Hey, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. That that's big. That's a huge can of worms. You can't just wave that away. Tell me, tell me about it. What's the issue with Future.went. then.

@Billy O'Neal [34:43]: Mhm Oh, well, sorry, I'm waving it away because I was not participating in that discussion. I just know that, I just know that the concurrencyTS has future than

@Vinnie [34:55]: Oh, darn it.

@Billy O'Neal [35:00]: And my, again, this is like 3 levels of hearsay. My understanding is that the people who did the concurrencyTS were mostly Microsoft people. And for them the answer for dot then is obvious. It's use of in a new Windows tadpole request because that's when we think about everything in terms of the, of, in terms of the windows. So I pull and the other platforms don't have, well, sorry, Mac OSS Grand Central Dispatch, but, but, like the posaki, the other posi platforms didn't have a systems threadpole equivalent. And so for them, where does that then run is not an obvious question

@Billy O'Neal [35:33]: And so without an answer to that, the concurrency test was not going to land, and then that ultimately got merged with the networking problem because that then it like, Taskot then is trying to kind of solve the same problem networkingTS is trying to solve in terms of when the network call comes back, what, what happens then?

@Billy O'Neal [35:53]: So,

@Vinnie [35:56]: That this is all very

@Billy O'Neal [35:56]: I'm sorry, I'm trying, this is kind of rambly, but you kind of asked me to be rambly, so I'm trying

@Vinnie [35:58]: No, no, it's. Yes, no, what you just said, this is, by the way, this is knowledge. You don't, you don't realize it, but this is gold, and the AI can figure it out because this is, let me tell you what I heard and what the AI will probably hear is that while you're not an expert in the future, you didn't participate in the meetings, yet you know about the problem, which suggests that it has importance, that this is a call to what we call a coordination problem.

@Billy O'Neal [36:11]: Sure No Mhm Yes, so,

@Billy O'Neal [36:27]: Sorry, I was talking about concurrency run time and that didn't land and oh yes, the problem with task-based concurrency, this is where I was going, it's really, really, really, really easy to write a program with task-based concurrency that looks like it works great until you run the system print production and you need the 513 thread.

@Vinnie [36:48]: OK.

@Billy O'Neal [36:50]: Because it's really easy to accidentally write A blocking task. something that blocks that needs a later thing in the threadpole queue to happen.

@Vinnie [37:04]: Question, let me ask you this. What exactly is task-based concurrency.

@Billy O'Neal [37:12]: So The, a sort of competing school of asynchrony with the concurrencyTS. So the concurrent CTS has you pass around, I think it's Io context is the is the is the networkingTS concurrency thingy, and that represents

@Billy O'Neal [37:33]: If you squint, again, that that's not, it's not, this is not the truth, but it's close enough to the truth for purposes of discussion. where continuations happen. So like you could think of different IO contexts as threats.

@Vinnie [37:49]: Yes

@Billy O'Neal [37:49]: Kind of, if you squint. And live UV has UV underscore loop is the equivalent for Lib UV and Windows Message pumps, this, so this idea of like a message pump of like this is the cue of work to do, and we will retire that work in order. And it's really easy when you have explicit message pumps to not write things that block incorrectly because you can run the message pump with one thread.

@Billy O'Neal [38:15]: And if you write something that blocks, your program will deadlock immediately because I am holding this right hostage and it's not pumping me the message to deliver my completion. Task-based concurrency is like the competing opposite side of this is where we assume there's sort of some sort of ambient scheduling or whatever, and we only talk about the results

@Billy O'Neal [38:39]: Of that. So like instead of you pass in the thread where you want the completion to happen into a function, function returns a promised or a future or a task to deliver the result to you at some point. And

@Billy O'Neal [38:57]: It's really easy to block on that task by accident. So if you want to write the safe thing that doesn't devo with task-based and currency. You have to use the The funky meattic thing which I've never written myself. I never got this to actually work. Like you have to use the fact that task of task of tea unwraps to task of tea.

@Vinnie [39:14]: The Moatic thing

@Billy O'Neal [39:21]: So, instead of blocking on the results, Where the IO happens, you have to return the task that the IO returned.

@Vinnie [39:30]: Hmm There's a level of indirection

@Billy O'Neal [39:35]: Yeah, and the problem is that nobody actually doesn't like programmers who are given task-based currency don't do that. So, we got Lots of people who complained of like, I deployed this web server like ages and ages ago and now my most important client is hitting it with a meaningful load and it died. And it died because they wrote

@Billy O'Neal [39:56]: Something that blocks And that worked fine until they exhausted 512 threads, which is the, the limit, and We had no answer for them other than go audit all of the code you have ever written for.

@Billy O'Neal [40:13]: Blocking on the results of tasks. So, like The networking TS model is a lot harder to write. But like, if it works, it's probably correct. Whereas the task model

@Vinnie [40:29]: I, I, I, I agree with you. I've observed there's a certain there's a the bar is higher in terms of the skill level. There's no question about it. I can't deny that.

@Billy O'Neal [40:40]: Whereas with task-based concurrency, it's really easy to write something that looks like it works, but has really subtle non-local like You don't realize what has happened. And also, again, it's harder to test because the the explicit callback, explicit message pump models you can run them with one thread and test your program. And if it works with one thread, then it's correct. And if it doesn't work with one thread, then you need to go fix whatever you did that's

@Billy O'Neal [41:10]: Blocking on something that hasn't happened yet. But anyway, sorry, other task-based concurrency implementations you asked those examples, I gave, I gave Message pump examples like the networkingTS, but there's also a concurrency run time was our attempts, there's also HPX

@Vinnie [41:19]: Yeah

@Billy O'Neal [41:32]: Is an implementation Jeez, I know examples in other languages, but I don't know of any other C++ examples, I guess.

@Vinnie [41:44]: That's OK. Any language

@Billy O'Neal [41:47]: Like they tried to make Stood Future into that with the concurrencyTS, but it, that never got merged, so I don't think that counts. But like C has task of T, which is the same thing. it was made by the same people who built the concurrency run time for us.

@Vinnie [41:55]: Let me, let me ask. I got a question

@Billy O'Neal [42:07]: Mhm

@Vinnie [42:07]: About all this C++20O routines.

@Billy O'Neal [42:12]: Mhm

@Vinnie [42:13]: They, they seem great. I mean, they seem controversial. I know I went back and forth on it. I mean, there's pros and cons, but it's here Where are all the apps? Where are all the cool libraries? Like, where's the ecosystem of co-awaitables.

@Billy O'Neal [42:28]: A lot of the C 20 features have this problem of there's a good feature in there somewhere, and the ecosystem has had difficulty deploying it. like, and co routines, the big problem was curtains need a library component, and nobody has agreed yet on what the library component is.

@Vinnie [42:48]: Why do they need a library component?

@Billy O'Neal [42:48]: Like Like Covertines is the core language Bits that you would need to implement The weightables Like it's the, it's the thing that makes task-based concurrency looks shiny.

@Billy O'Neal [43:06]: I guess. Like instead of having right that then then then then then over and over again, you can write what looks like serial code and it will be do the right thing. but like, you need what the task of tea is, or the future of tea is, and

@Vinnie [43:06]: Finish that.

@Billy O'Neal [43:23]: Executors are are I think it's executors No, it's not, it's Is that the right word? I'm sorry, it's been like 5.

@Vinnie [43:36]: You you you said you need to know what you said you need to know what the tea is

@Billy O'Neal [43:41]: It, like, I forget, it's been like 5 years since I looked at this. The, the thing that

@Vinnie [43:46]: Like the return type

@Billy O'Neal [43:48]: Yeah, like you need the thing that the awaitable returns is expected to return, that implements all of the Get Co routine frame stuff,

@Vinnie [44:00]: OK

@Billy O'Neal [44:00]: In order to like put the C+20 feature into practice. So like my understanding is there are lots of people who are using this. But Not in a way that interopts with anyone else. So like I'm told I have not seen the code myself, but I like I am told that like

@Billy O'Neal [44:20]: Internet information services uses this in their implementation of their HTTP stack, and to be fair, that's where a lot of the initial proposals, the, the initial core routines proposal that was ultimately adopted came from. It was, well, we're using this and, and

@Billy O'Neal [44:40]: You know, we, we think the standard should adopt it. But, like, without the library vocabulary type for people to talk about. What do co routines return. They just kind of haven't been adopted very much because they don't actually do anything on their own. They need the what do you attach them to, in order for them to become vocabulary things.

@Billy O'Neal [45:06]: And other other examples would be like modules, like

@Vinnie [45:10]: Oh

@Billy O'Neal [45:11]: I have yet to see, like, I work on VC package like we talk about packaging things and shipping them to other things. It is 6 2026, and we have nothing that uses C++ modules. Because To get modules to work, everybody has to agree on what the build system does and in practice nobody agrees on a build system.

@Vinnie [45:33]: So what you're, OK, let me stop you there. All right, so you've just identified what in great founder theory is called the coordination problem, right? Is that is that there's a, there's, you have a problem to be solved and it requires that people to collaborate, to exchange information, and come to what's called a shelling point. Tell me about this coordination failure.

@Billy O'Neal [45:40]: Mhm Oh, well So I guess I should say I don't have

@Billy O'Neal [45:58]: Experience myself trying to do this. So again, please keep in mind this is hearsay. but, but like

@Vinnie [46:02]: That's OK.

@Billy O'Neal [46:05]: My limited understanding is the module C+ 20 modules require some kind of coordination between the compiler and the build system to do like the Figure out what textual module files depend on each other. So that you can have a correct partial rebuild.

@Vinnie [46:21]: So, wait, wait. So what you're saying is, OK, so you have your compilers, you have your compiler vendors, that's one actor, but then they're not the authors of the of the package system of the build system, right? So maybe that would be like MSVCCL.EXC and then versus C make. So because those are two different actors, two different organizations, they have to communicate. They need a common language.

@Billy O'Neal [46:33]: Yes. So No, that, that's not the problem. Like, like build systems and compilers communicate with each other all the time because it's a one-way interaction, like the compiler says I have this feature, and then the build system follows the compiler vendor's documentation on how to access whatever that feature is. This is about build systems communicating with other build systems is the problem. So

@Vinnie [46:53]: No Oh

@Billy O'Neal [47:06]: Like Component A is built with CA. Component B is built with auto tools.

@Vinnie [47:13]: Oh

@Billy O'Neal [47:14]: How does component A written in C make convey the right compiler switches to engage modules correctly to component be written in autotools.

@Vinnie [47:22]: Wow Yeah

@Billy O'Neal [47:25]: So, like, there are build systems that within themselves have consistent, again, I am told, have consistent implementations of modules of C++ modules. So like if you're, if all of, if you and all, if all of the things that matter in your build are built with build to to or Build XL or I think even CMA has a mode you can turn on. you can use modules, and it will supposedly work.

@Vinnie [47:56]: Nice

@Billy O'Neal [47:57]: But as soon as you have a dependency that exists in your bill, that uses a different build system than that. well, the different build systems don't agree on how bindings to modules actually work.

@Vinnie [48:10]: Oh, I see.

@Billy O'Neal [48:12]: So, And for better or worse, there are two kinds of de facto ways to build systems communicate with each other like this. There is package config and there is CA configs. And Really it's package configures the standard everybody supports, and seamate configs are a de facto standard CMA is like 95% of build systems, at least, at least looking at DC packages registry anyway.

@Billy O'Neal [48:41]: So Yeah, like how, like, and to be fair, the kitwa folks have been trying to collaborate with the Mizon, I think the Mean folks, and they're trying to come up with this like common common package system or con like CPS standard that's trying to do this kind of build system can talk about targets and compiler settings and stuff between each other, but at the moment, the only system that implements CPS is CMA.

@Billy O'Neal [49:14]: And CMake already has CMA configs, so this package has not lifted a finger to support this because our Position is like we don't need a third de facto standard to compete here. Like, we need at least one built system that is not CMA to implement this in order for it to be worth integrating and for now we're going to tell people keep using package configure or seemate configs.

@Billy O'Neal [49:39]: Because, and I guess maybe I should clarify cause this might not be Obvious. There are compiler switches like my headers are here to use me, you need to throw slash I path to my header directory.

@Vinnie [49:53]: OK

@Billy O'Neal [49:54]: There are also communications like I need standard version 1234. For my headers to work.

@Vinnie [50:05]: It sounds very complicated.

@Billy O'Neal [50:08]: There are things like to link with me, you need to throw this flag to the linker and on the Posix platforms this is a lot more complicated because you have to also put them in the right order. Because of the Windows Linkers traditionally don't care about the order, they just keep

@Vinnie [50:28]: Oh, that's right, dude, the order matters. I hate when that happens. I've got that kidney.

@Billy O'Neal [50:28]: You know, wait till they Yes. So like package config. So package configs are really Like, it's the, it's the de facto standard because it's like the minimum viable thing that works. It's like I am named this to use me use for these compiler switches and these linker switches, and that's it.

@Billy O'Neal [50:51]: And Different.PC writers are expected to Convey their dependencies in the right order, and that works. CMA configs are kind of the same thing, but instead of the textual talking about compiler command lines, they expose scenic targets.

@Billy O'Neal [51:10]: So you can include somebody's Sime config and say target link libraries that dependency over there and CMI figures out how Like which compiler switches from your dependency you need to apply to you. So, anyway, we need this solution, but that can talk about the modules configuration problem and

@Billy O'Neal [51:32]: Since None of the belt systems have landed on a common way to talk about this. It's a lot, it, I, I don't see a path where that's can be solved anytime soon.

@Vinnie [51:42]: I wanna throw this out. I wanna throw this out there. I love writing, I love writing C++. I hate writing C make lists, and I don't like writing CI.YML either, and thanks to AI, I tell you I've been so much more effective at writing sea make lists.

@Billy O'Neal [51:45]: Sure. Mhm. I think

@Billy O'Neal [52:03]: See, I think it's biggest problem is Documentation In that they have really good docs for the trees, and they have no docks for the forests.

@Vinnie [52:15]: Oh, that's a really good. Say that again. I love that. Seemate.

@Billy O'Neal [52:18]: CMA has really good docks for the trees and no docks for the forest. Like what each individual CA function cult does is documented to an extreme degree. But how packages are expected to communicate with each other, like, what does the hello world see make library that publishes configuration about itself. There's no like hello world example for that in CMixs documentation.

@Billy O'Neal [52:43]: And because there is no hello world example, everybody has invented it their own way slightly differently. And my job as VC package maintainer is mostly about whacking library maintainers over the head and being like, no, you need to do this for it to work.

@Vinnie [52:58]: I wanna pause you, I wanna pause you right there. So and I've, I've been using Cursor, which is a variant of VS code.

@Billy O'Neal [53:00]: Sure Yes, I am, I have not used, but I'm familiar in concept.

@Vinnie [53:08]: I've been a visual studio user I can't even remember when I started, but forever. For the first time in my life, I've actually entertained the possibility of changing IDEs, and so now I'm in Cursor, which is like VS code, and my productivity at, at like running, setting breakpoints, building it's gone way down because I don't understand it and see make is so central to it, and I keep having this problem with seaak where like I need, I need presets and I need a user config and I need a settings.json and I need to launch this and that.

@Billy O'Neal [53:16]: Mhm. Mhm.

@Vinnie [53:38]: So I used AI to summarize. I just gave you a link to a document which explains what do Windows people need to know about CA. Check, check out that document. A deep tutorial for Windows development.

@Billy O'Neal [53:49]: Yeah

@Vinnie [53:50]: So I have to wonder, is it possible because what you're describing is you're saying Sea has a good reference, but it doesn't have a good tutorial. Like, what is the philosophy of CMA? Is that something that an AI can synthesize?

@Billy O'Neal [54:02]: I should clarify. It has tutorials But like The outcomes of the tutorials are still trees, not the forest. Like, how does my component produce seamate configs? They have a tutorial for

@Vinnie [54:18]: Yes

@Billy O'Neal [54:18]: But like What that's for. There's no tutorial for it. Like, they need like the next level of like somebody who depends on my exported configs, and they don't have anything that looks like that. in particular, the behavior of Fang dependency is not

@Vinnie [54:26]: No

@Billy O'Neal [54:37]: Described anywhere, and I'm curious if that's in here. Find dependency. No, it's not in the AI summary either. So if you have dependencies, like you called Find package, whatever.

@Vinnie [54:49]: Right

@Billy O'Neal [54:50]: Like I called fine Packet Zib. It made a semiar named Zitt. And then I called Target Link Libraries my component, Publiczelib. OK, if I export my own configs, they will fail to import. In my consumers because they don't know what the ZLID target is.

@Billy O'Neal [55:11]: So, like, your configs need to say find underscoreependency. Zib So that when they're pulled in, it works. and this, and there is a doc for it if you look for seamate find dependency macro.

@Vinnie [55:30]: Nice. OK

@Billy O'Neal [55:32]: Yeah, here's the Here's the thing,

@Vinnie [55:36]: Yeah, OK, OK

@Billy O'Neal [55:37]: So, like, if you call find package, then in your exported bits,

@Vinnie [55:41]: Oh

@Billy O'Neal [55:43]: You need to say find underscoreependency, all of the things that you called for a fine package. And this is not described anywhere like the behavior of fine dependency is, and what fine package does is, but that you need to do this or things break is not.

@Vinnie [56:01]: You, you know what, I think you just captured exactly what I've been feeling for the last two weeks, which is, I keep getting, I keep my, my IDE keeps misbehaving because of CA. I go to the documentation and I try to understand it and I'm told things that look correct on the face of it, and they probably are, yet I'm no closer to a solution.

@Billy O'Neal [56:18]: Yes Yeah, it's, it's Yeah, there's that problem and I guess the other problem is that

@Vinnie [56:23]: There.

@Billy O'Neal [56:27]: It's not If you don't eat build systems for breakfast, it's not clear that like what CAC is doing while it is parsing your CA lists is there's like this object model off to the side of like, there are libraries and targets and executables and stuff.

@Billy O'Neal [56:47]: And like CMAC is running your CAC lists and taking outputs out of that and adding that to this object model off to the side. Like you call ad library, it goes, OK, there's a library named this. And then their generators look at that produced representation.

@Billy O'Neal [57:05]: And spit out the ninja or the Visual Studio project or the eclipse project or whatever, like, the whole reason CMA has become the de facto standard, is it, it's like the Was you said coordination problem. It's

@Vinnie [57:18]: Coordination problem, yes. Coordinate well.

@Billy O'Neal [57:19]: It's, it's attempting to solve the coordination problem by saying, OK, you write this and then you can munge it into what everything else. So

@Vinnie [57:30]: I like that. That's very interesting. What, OK, here, let me give you something that I've experienced is, you know, I, I dip my toes into like Express JS. I've dipped my toes into Anoro, the documentation system, and I have to like install, and I have to install stuff. I'm building a new, I'm building Beast too, and I've decided to copy Express JS because it's really cool. It's like this in 5 lines of code you can do like what takes 1000 lines in C++. So I'm going to the little NPM package registry, and I'm looking at their little packages and I'm like

@Billy O'Neal [57:44]: Mhm Mhm

@Vinnie [58:03]: There's some packages that are like there are only 200 lines, and like, and then they depend on these other packages, but it's, I'm like, I'm feeling a little jealous like they can just grab packages and they can just grab all these functionality really quick and put things together so quickly, and for me it's all this this tryhard. It's like a marathon like, oh, I got to get the dependencies. Why is it so different for us?

@Billy O'Neal [58:25]: Well Couple reasons. The biggest one is NPM was there at the beginning of that entire ecosystem, and NPM got to set a whole bunch of rules about how packages inter interoperate with each other. That make the package management problem a lot easier. So for example,

@Billy O'Neal [58:44]: In NPM you implement semantic versioning. Period. End of story. Your versions are semantic versions. C++, VC package has to deal with versions like Vista. And so like

@Billy O'Neal [59:00]: VC package has a versioning feature, but we have to deal with this thing that like we can't even order your versions. Like, is Vista newer than 7 VC package doesn't know. and so if you put us into this situation, we just have to throw up our hands and say user pick one, like, like Vista doesn't start earlier or later than 7 because they're both arbitrary strings and you know we do have some subsets that are orderable. So like if you tell us my package does implement Semer, then we will order them that way. But

@Billy O'Neal [59:36]: Like, that's a whole extra pile of complexity that we have that MPM just doesn't have. They're just like, no, it's semver too bad. In particular, the, the other thing about Semver is it talks about versions that exist in the future.

@Vinnie [59:51]: What

@Billy O'Neal [59:51]: So Yeah, so like it's the normal way you declare dependency in in in NPM world, as you say, like I support this major version of that.

@Vinnie [59:54]: Hm

@Billy O'Neal [1:00:02]: And it's expected that I'll work with all future things that are under the same major version because under the semverbals, if you make breaking changes, you need to bump the major version number.

@Vinnie [1:00:10]: Yes Right. That makes sense

@Billy O'Neal [1:00:16]: So, like, they can, you can publish a new package that's like under this stack of a whole bunch of stuff. And then the NPM universe, that's expected to function. You're expected to be able to update that thing underneath everybody. Because everybody is supposed to follow the Semb rules.

@Billy O'Neal [1:00:34]: If you don't, if people don't follow the several rules, well, now what? and that's kind of where VC packages. Like we don't have less than version constraints. We only have greater than because we don't think it's practical in C plus ecosystem to talk about versions in the future.

@Vinnie [1:00:52]: That's fair. That's, that's pretty fair.

@Billy O'Neal [1:00:55]: So that's problem number one. problem number 2 is the one definition rule. So, no. JS Has no problem loading multiple versions of something at the same time.

@Vinnie [1:01:07]: How do they do that? Oh, because it's just text.

@Billy O'Neal [1:01:10]: Yeah, it's just text and like everybody's reference to everybody else's relatives, so like this part of the tree cannot say I want less padded version 1.0, and this part of the tree can say I want left pad at version 2.0, and that works.

@Vinnie [1:01:12]: OK. Right, that makes sense.

@Billy O'Neal [1:01:24]: Whereas like the most common feature requests we get on our VC packages, people want alternatives like I have this library and I support OpenSSL or Wolf SS SSL. And we have to say sorry, but like we can't model that in our system because We can't build them simultaneously, like that won't link. They'll want the same symbol names.

@Vinnie [1:01:44]: By the way, I just want to throw this out there. This is an aside. I have, I'm developing a new network library, and it supports OpenSSL and the Wolf SSL.

@Billy O'Neal [1:01:51]: Hm Yes

@Vinnie [1:01:56]: Wait, it gets better, and they can both exist in the same process.

@Billy O'Neal [1:02:01]: Yes. So

@Vinnie [1:02:02]: And when, no, but wait, no wait, there's more, and my and my tests connect them together as clients and servers and swapping to make sure that they work together. And wait, get this, are you ready for this? You're gonna love this. Are you sitting down? Debbie sitting down.

@Billy O'Neal [1:02:03]: Pearl does this. OK. Yes Yes Yes

@Vinnie [1:02:18]: You, you can create a library using my, like my lib, and then, and you can use, it can use TLS and you can

@Billy O'Neal [1:02:22]: Mhm

@Vinnie [1:02:27]: Just by linking it with a different library. You don't have to recompile your library. You can link it with a different library. You can switch the OpenSSL implementations and, and you can even choose the SSL implementation at runtime.

@Billy O'Neal [1:02:36]: Yes. Yes. So, Pearl does this Curl is the only library that we have in VC package that has SSL that has TLS features.

@Vinnie [1:02:51]: Right.

@Billy O'Neal [1:02:51]: And that's because they actually do the work to support multiple concurrent discovered TLS implementations at run time, exactly what you're describing.

@Vinnie [1:03:00]: Yes

@Billy O'Neal [1:03:01]: So, like, people keep complaining to us, they're like, Curl has a feature named OpenSSL. Why can't I have one? And our answers

@Vinnie [1:03:09]: But there are two written fe

@Billy O'Neal [1:03:12]: But like The problem is you have like the library author has to bend over backwards to make that work. Like, you can't do it with an if def that says pick one. And the problem is that people don't. Like in practice, everybody like they put a

@Vinnie [1:03:20]: That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, yeah.

@Billy O'Neal [1:03:29]: Has to sell star in their strut or something, and then they have different versions for the Wolf SSL1 or the or the OpenSSL one. And as soon as you do that, well, like, like our acid test for them is, can I turn on both features like of a hard assumption for VC packages, turning on features is always assumed to be safe. So like

@Vinnie [1:03:40]: Yeah, that's weird

@Billy O'Neal [1:03:53]: 8, or sorry, like B depends on A with feature one and C depends on A with feature 2. We assume we can give you a feature 12, and BNC have to be OK with that. Like, if you, if you're, if you get more features of your dependency than you asked for. That has to work. But people want

@Billy O'Neal [1:04:13]: OpenSSL and Wolf SSL features, and that means that doesn't work. Again, unless you're doing what I said, I guess you're doing with these two or with Carl. So We can't model that and we have to tell everybody who complains about this. We have to tell them like, sorry, but you have to use overlays. Like you can put a big comment in our registry that says, hey, if you want this other option, you can do it this way, but

@Billy O'Neal [1:04:39]: Like, our registry has to have a canonical like TLS is open SSL.

@Vinnie [1:04:45]: Let me ask you this, OK, so my, so my journey, my programming, my library designing journey has, it's taken this really dramatic arc because in the beginning I loved generic coding. I loved ASIO, you know, I loved all that stuff. I loved concept-driven development, but over time I've become more and more annoyed with it. I like the power, but I don't like the price. So, I have my, my new philosophy is I don't like making multiple versions of my li

@Billy O'Neal [1:04:52]: Mhm Mhm.

@Vinnie [1:05:15]: Bra ry like no conditional compilation flags. Now you don't get to, if you don't get to define a macro and then cause my library to spit out a different version. I hate that. So my, so my solution for the TLS is I provide the base library and then I provide a second build target which is like a wolf SSL lib. You link with that if you want it, then you have an open SSL. You link with that if you want it, but they, you link it with the main one, right? So my question to you is how does that interact with the package manager.

@Billy O'Neal [1:05:33]: Mhm

@Vinnie [1:05:43]: Is that 3 different

@Billy O'Neal [1:05:43]: Well, so in your case, I would probably assuming that you're two different TLS implementations don't take the same symbol names, like they're link compatible with each other. Then they could just be features.

@Vinnie [1:05:51]: Right, you know, right.

@Billy O'Neal [1:05:56]: Like I would have, I

@Vinnie [1:05:56]: Oh, she

@Billy O'Neal [1:05:57]: Yeah Yeah

@Vinnie [1:05:58]: OK

@Billy O'Neal [1:06:00]: So like this package, we do have features in libraries, so you can declare like I depend on this with feature A turned on, but that's what I'm saying, like, if we have two things that depend on a shared dependency and like this one wants feature one and this one wants feature two. We assume we can give you shared dependency with both features turned on, that has to work.

@Vinnie [1:06:21]: Gotcha

@Billy O'Neal [1:06:22]: Which doesn't work for this alternative situation. So like we have this maintainer guide with we just add to whenever we see people do things that are wrong. that's, that's not the right way to say that. Things that are problematic for maintenance of the registry.

@Vinnie [1:06:22]: OK

@Billy O'Neal [1:06:38]: Because they're not wrong, they could be correct for what that customer is doing, but like there are things we won't merge, and like the most common one is do not use features to implement alternatives.

@Vinnie [1:06:48]: No, mine would be like so a features like an add-on, so you get your basic library and then the features like in addition to not in lieu of.

@Billy O'Neal [1:06:56]: Yes, yes, that is exactly what features are supposed to be, but, but, but people see like this library has enables_OnSSL and enables_wolfSSL, and they don't think about the fact that those like their build system treats those as mutually incompatible switches. And so we have to tell them like, look, like I have to be able to install your thing with no features turned on and with both feat features turned on individually and all of the features turned on together and like

@Vinnie [1:06:57]: OK, good. Yeah, that's what I like, I like that.

@Vinnie [1:07:14]: Got you

@Billy O'Neal [1:07:26]: Downstream dependencies have to be able to work, which is what breaks with this alternative state. Like if you have things that pick different back ends, and you can only pick one, like That sucks that we don't have a great way to model that in VC package, but we don't because like

@Vinnie [1:07:42]: I wanna give, by the way, I wanna give you a heads up. I have like I have 5 minutes and then they're ringing the dinner bell.

@Billy O'Neal [1:07:47]: Sure That's fair. I probably have to go somewhere as well, but

@Vinnie [1:07:50]: And let me tell you this, this conversation has surpassed my wildest dreams. This knowledge, when I show you the capture file, you're gonna love it.

@Billy O'Neal [1:07:55]: OK OK That's fair.

@Vinnie [1:08:00]: You're gonna love it. It's gonna be, you're gonna, you're gonna be amazed, cause these stories are so good, like I've learned so much. Oh hey, what's this man?

@Billy O'Neal [1:08:08]: I'm, I'm glad it's helpful.

@Vinnie [1:08:12]: OK, anything, any, you want to tell me anything like, like

@Billy O'Neal [1:08:12]: So

@Vinnie [1:08:15]: What's like the most interesting thing that you that you know? I don't know, it's a crazy question.

@Billy O'Neal [1:08:19]: Most interesting thing that I know, I don't know, I mean, we've gone through a lot of random crap. The most interesting project I still work, I worked on, I still think is our parallel algorithms implementation because I still think we Are better than the other, than the other standard libraries, but, but that's a, that's a

@Vinnie [1:08:34]: Oh nice

@Billy O'Neal [1:08:39]: Principled argument that wasn't in, that's, that's hard to convey like my design goal with that was always minimize badness when people use it incorrectly.

@Vinnie [1:08:49]: Hmm, mhm

@Billy O'Neal [1:08:49]: Like, I don't care if HPX wins on, you know, summit on your massive supercomputer or whatever. I care that somebody throws parallel for each with like 5 elements that, that doesn't Bring their program to its knees. and a lot of paraly implementations are just like, no, that's the user's fault, like don't do that. And I'm like, no, this is stood, this is a thing that people who don't know what they're doing are going to reach for. It needs to have training wheels.

@Vinnie [1:09:19]: Well, Howard, Howard Hinne in one in my interview, he said, I asked him, I said, you know, some people, they say that they're like string view. It's very dangerous or like just even a reference parameter could be very dangerous, and I said, what do you think about that? He said, he said, well, you know, like a, a pocket knife is dangerous, you know, it could cut you and like kitchen knives are dangerous, but they're also useful.

@Billy O'Neal [1:09:29]: Mhm Yes Sure, but I, I, that, see, to me, that would be an argument to not have parallel algorithms at all. What I'm saying is

@Vinnie [1:09:44]: Wow

@Billy O'Neal [1:09:46]: Right, cause like you could write the, you know, you could touch shared thing in your for each loop body and break the universe. But no, no, no, I'm not saying like, It's really easy to Be wearing your paralym hat and have this benchmark that takes like 2 gigabytes of input and go like, look, I made this change and I made that benchmark 5% faster.

@Billy O'Neal [1:10:08]: And you don't think about the fact that it made the average person calling it with n is 200. Like Take twice as long. so like for example, We Race with the background provided thread, and if the foreground threat wins, we just cancel it.

@Vinnie [1:10:30]: Yo, I like that

@Billy O'Neal [1:10:30]: So like, so like the maximum, so like the maximum possible overhead of a parallel algorithms call is just allocating the threadful task.

@Vinnie [1:10:31]: Let's take it up to the kitchen.

@Billy O'Neal [1:10:41]: And that's one of the reasons why we beat the crap out of concurrency run time because I was testing with N is like 2000, like sorting, like people think 2000 is a lot, like, no, like for, for paraism purposes, like if it fits in L2, paraelism probably loses.

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:01]: Probably, unless like it's N log N or worse. So like sorting 22,000 elements, I can get parallelism to win, but like Partition 2000 Elements? No, no, like, serial will win cause

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:17]: That latency and stuff,

@Vinnie [1:11:20]: All right, we're gonna wrap it up. Do you, do you have any questions for me?

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:21]: So, but yeah, so, yeah, but our paralleloriation and of course I did it all whole talk about that where I had all the SG1 people in the audience grilling me. So.

@Vinnie [1:11:32]: Do you have any questions for me? Do you want, is there anything you wanna know?

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:36]: No, I guess not.

@Vinnie [1:11:38]: OK, if not, it's OK, if not.

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:40]: Yeah, I'm not Yeah, I don't know. I didn't come to this with agenda, I guess, other than like, are you happy and or is there anything cool you're doing other than this knowledge recording thing.

@Vinnie [1:11:53]: Then, you know, the the knowledge recording is just, it's like a fun thing, you know what I mean? It's just I, I, it's very interesting and I, I feel like that might inspire. I don't know, I'm hoping to inspire people. The main work that we're doing right now is, you know, I'm trying to revive boost because

@Billy O'Neal [1:11:57]: Mhm. Mhm Mhm.

@Vinnie [1:12:08]: You know, it needs a lot of.

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:08]: Yeah, I just saw there's a website redesign.

@Vinnie [1:12:11]: Oh, nice. Hey, what you don't know is, that's only temporary. That was just a down payment. We're actually doing an even bigger redesign from the top web design firm, and when, when the new new website launches, people are going to be shocked.

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:23]: All right

@Vinnie [1:12:24]: I'm doing, I'm working on Beastas 2. It's going to be super high level. It's basically I'm copying Express JS.

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:28]: Mhm.

@Vinnie [1:12:32]: You so you can make like

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:32]: Yeah, you mentioned

@Vinnie [1:12:34]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:34]: I haven't used that myself, so I, I don't have a good dental model of what that means, but.

@Vinnie [1:12:37]: It's really nice, you can use 3 lines of code and you have a server and then on the client I'm implementing what we call burl. Now, that's, it's like curl, but it's boost curl. I get it, Burl,

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:42]: Mhm. Yeah Yes

@Vinnie [1:12:52]: I, I'm puffing the cover routine sauce. I'm going full C+ + 20 core routines only, so that's turning out to be fun. I think we'll see how it goes, we'll see how it goes. I'll, I'll wait to get the transcript and then I'll, I'll email you, but listen, thank, thank you so much, Billy. It's so nice to talk to you.

@Billy O'Neal [1:12:58]: Mhm No problem. I'll be really curious what results you get with co routines because that is, like you mentioned that, and that is a thing that's, it's very interesting to me because like, I see that deployed successfully in languages that are not C++.

@Vinnie [1:13:21]: You want me to, I'll tell you, I'm gonna tell you, cause I like you. I'm gonna give you a little trail, a little preview.

@Billy O'Neal [1:13:21]: Like Sure OK.

@Vinnie [1:13:27]: Peter Dimov has been a fucking pain in my ass because I've been supporting C++ 11, you know, callbacks. I support co routines if they're available through ASIO. Might Project was using ASIO, and every time I would ask a design question about like how do I accommodate like you know, callbacks like in some API, Peter would go just use Coverines, bro, and for and I'm listening to.

@Billy O'Neal [1:13:29]: Mhm Mhm

@Billy O'Neal [1:13:47]: Mhm

@Vinnie [1:13:52]: And I'm listening, I'm listening to this for 3 years. He's like, just use cover teeth, bro, and then, and then, but wait, when I got the AI, I got clawed and then I got cursor and then I got the AI and I was like, I'm going to show him because Co routines suck and I'm gonna prove it and I, I made, I made this benchmark where I, I designed a little, a little, a little, you know, test harness for callbacks and a little test harness for co routines, and it was the co routines were absolutely terrible, but guess what? Then I discovered you

@Billy O'Neal [1:13:56]: Mhm

@Vinnie [1:14:22]: Need to do memory recycling in both, and a funny thing happened, Billy, as you, a funny thing happened as you get to higher levels of abstraction like co routines on top of the co routines. The co-routines start winning.

@Billy O'Neal [1:14:30]: Mhm I'm not that surprised because that's what, that was the whole thesis of Gore's talk.

@Vinnie [1:14:40]: Yes, but, but it's

@Billy O'Neal [1:14:40]: Ages and ages ago. If you remember, it was co routines a negative overhead abstraction.

@Vinnie [1:14:43]: But it Well that was BS come on, let's give it negative overhead. Come on, man. No.

@Billy O'Neal [1:14:47]: Well, I mean, the Well, like That optimizers do better when they can see and understand the Covertine frame. Makes sense to me.

@Vinnie [1:15:00]: It does, but he that was marketing, that was marketing, dude. That was, it was brilliant. Gore was absolutely he pitched his product like, man, I thought he was going to be on TV selling like cheese graters, you know.

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:11]: I don't know. I mean, that was, my understanding is that was real data from the SQL people,

@Vinnie [1:15:16]: But think about it, what like negative overhead, what that means that it makes your computer faster than it is. That's like time travel. Come on.

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:23]: No, it means what you write with co routines is faster than what, than trying to do the same thing with handwritten callbacks. Like that was the

@Vinnie [1:15:32]: Oh.

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:33]: That was the thesis.

@Vinnie [1:15:34]: Oh, negative overhead sounds like, like, you know, free energy, I mean, to the layman, to the layman, right? You know,

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:38]: But that's fair Yeah, that, that's fair, but like that's what he was talking about. It's like we, we had sequel people replace their thing with urines. Yeah.

@Vinnie [1:15:44]: But my look, my, my point is this. Here's my point. My point is I discovered, like I said, co routines can be viable, but it's tricky. So

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:48]: Mhm

@Vinnie [1:15:53]: I am now we are working on something that I can't believe nobody's done it yet. I'm shocked, but I think we're going to show the real actual power of co routines. We have something that's really great.

@Billy O'Neal [1:15:58]: Mhm I am I, I look forward to seeing like what happens with I don't know, like I want to be in the room where

@Billy O'Neal [1:16:14]: I, I don't work with Gore anymore, full, full disclosure. he, he went and now works on some funky thing in Windows Kernel Land. I believe, but Like, I want to show him like Cause we had conversations about like, how do we sell video on co routines? And so, and so I would love to see that. It's just

@Vinnie [1:16:35]: We just. Willy, listen, man, I can admit when I'm wrong. OK? I can, I can admit when I'm wrong. When I find evidence, if the even if the evidence is not to my liking, I have to go where it leads.

@Billy O'Neal [1:16:43]: That's fair That's fair

@Vinnie [1:16:50]: I have to because I want to deliver value for users. So, you know

@Billy O'Neal [1:16:55]: Well, I, I, I will high five you on this because I, I wish, I, I, I, I have found that to not be a very common. Trait. It's very, very, it's much more common for people to double down on things like, like I said, I've been an AI hater most of the time, but I've been had decent results last couple of weeks, so, you know, I'm having to change my tune a little bit.

@Vinnie [1:17:08]: Yes. If you guys wanna get together and have a laugh at my expense, I'm, I'm, I'm OK with that.

@Billy O'Neal [1:17:20]: No, no, I'm not gonna, I just want to see what he does.

@Vinnie [1:17:24]: Well, listen, if you do talk to him, tell him I said hi and thank you.

@Billy O'Neal [1:17:27]: Cause I tested inco routines. Like I was like, Gore's doing this cool thing. I would love to use it someday, but it's going to be like 6 years before I'm allowed to touch this in the STL, so

@Vinnie [1:17:37]: I'm, I'm, I've invested the rest of my life and I put everything on Cochees. I, I've gone all in. I pushed all my chips into Covertines.

@Billy O'Neal [1:17:41]: Wow All right. Well, luckily, I think I already has implementation these days, so you can do that.

@Vinnie [1:17:52]: Yeah, they, well, yeah, they do have that, but you know what's missing? Apple doesn't have the stop token or the J threads.

@Billy O'Neal [1:18:00]: Yeah.

@Vinnie [1:18:02]: Yeah. But I, that's not my problem.

@Billy O'Neal [1:18:03]: Well, in fairness, that's because Apple was mooching off Google for standard library maintenance and

@Vinnie [1:18:08]: All right, I'm gonna bounce for dinner.

@Billy O'Neal [1:18:09]: We'll laid off Eric, Barrick, WF.

@Vinnie [1:18:10]: Keep an eye on your meal within the hour. Billy, thank you so much and God bless you and your family. Thank you. Bye-bye.

@Billy O'Neal [1:18:15]: No problem. Oh, no problem, thank you. Have a great day.

@Vinnie [1:18:18]: You too
