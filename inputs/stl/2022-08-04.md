fac6b617-5b8a-4159-bcf1-076e8ba31014 Hi and welcome back to another VC libraries. e13a1c80-f84f-4ed1-944c-063288daf21d Open code review. 41d54e68-091a-443f-83a6-94b6c50ef387 Today we'll be looking at a C23 feature. 690ef49d-2b75-44bf-9945-c7f99fed22a8 This is a paper 1899 revision, 3094aa84-e84e-422a-bb38-4a5a0657a634 3 views stride on the GitHub PR is 2981 fd6cc814-2401-46f9-8738-872a35b177b7 from our GitHub contributor and I'm going 202b29d1-c37f-4dda-a2ad-cb87e4431bf8 to try to pronounce this Jay Mazurkiewicz 353a281a-aeed-43a6-a43a-192abd9d0c59 apologies if I've gotten that wrong. 54702c20-32a3-44b9-8aee-23fbdb7928de I am quite familiar with 5a21dc59-0094-4535-85de-9b0ff003bdad people mispronouncing my name, b3242eb8-ec64-4695-81d7-54fadb02752c so this is yet another ranges feature ranges. bd712590-b109-4642-aa95-3edc79bbd08e Added to CBS Plus 20 and are 62cc6e26-0945-4aad-9c4e-35f967a8010c being greatly expanded in C + 23, 6e802515-a0d5-4ba5-be30-494fb653f51d so we're going to look at the paper. 25e40b4e-0ba1-49ae-aa4e-c1e1f36f5f60 We're gonna look at the PR. 5aa3c090-3cac-469d-897d-2317b18505b4 It's about 1000 lines, a7940ac9-79e5-466c-b3c5-e7fe5f352039 but that's split between 080ebc73-6c00-48ef-bca8-83c38d89d712 product code and test code. 876197eb-b0e4-4472-9a77-82c0096f996a And let's say we have a 51948c5f-2e20-4278-87dd-31c34436bb3e note from our contributor. 271537e4-4a05-482e-b851-33bcf1f46f72 I've stood qualified all calls 77ce5ed2-6d5c-43af-88ac-e46b6704838e to forward and move and tests 5705e02c-328d-4278-ab9c-87e6fcbbfe29 because the next cling release is 5192e360-b87f-4e00-805c-16b56678dfae going to warn about unqualified, 3c3855ab-1dd3-4315-864f-553a954c3bca steadfast calls. 43a3508f-4bfd-450b-9e3d-dc829f87f50f That seems like it's going to actually 0d394c72-f3f0-4ca8-a1db-31387f758d52 be quite an obnoxious forwarding that 966a1420-d548-40c8-a745-b093d25458c8 we may need to suppress throughout 5fc255aa-2d51-4cb6-8a13-72a82eab5fab the test code base because we love 71457af5-c8c5-4aa6-b058-0bc22dc1f04f our using namespace stood in tests, e3ddbf56-236a-4a4d-a3ed-8ae9aa5af01c but I suppose that's acceptable for this PR. 2bfca9cb-53a9-468e-9253-ea42ab3e20f4 OK, 26112843-ed3e-40b8-b4f9-55ba986ce537 so let's take a quick look at df8cc7eb-7bc4-4854-b87a-adf39fa88259 our tracking issue and the paper, bf088931-f395-45cb-b1b8-6ddc89918390 and then we'll actually review 3fa12482-514a-476a-a7bc-4e5932083026 the PR so our tracking issue e820b24d-c7fc-4b77-b6c6-a56567b31e59 as usual after each G 21 or e7ad6e89-ee46-407d-917f-f190cd257fc6 Standardization Committee meeting, ed8ada4f-90dc-47cf-b20e-53a9be3c0a12 we go through and file tracking issues 8b2958c6-47f4-4a73-af3b-e9205a80f1ea for all the papers that were voted in, 24cedc5e-a7f7-4f11-8d5d-c4765a9141ba so this was voted in just 10 days. a603cd7e-634d-4be6-b8a0-45226db03a53 We've got a feature test macro, b7602829-2f1b-4a96-bbe0-e9d8ba1cd516 CPP, Lib ranges, 9fd8fb22-ad1c-424a-bc2e-6abe6f142d70 strides set the year and month of acceptance. 7bbd6c8f-dc7a-47ff-9768-e46bdad49033 So July 2022. cea0d00f-7a27-4788-9ae8-1bca05cdd6f8 And other than that, no other notes here. 2e1aaed3-fc56-4552-b50b-bfd796b7118d Here's where we'll note, 22797868-323c-45c2-8121-dfc6bfd03ff7 like, oh this, you know, 503037b9-cf9d-469b-818d-a43dc7c63e6f has a bunch of patch papers 407a6a6b-adf3-4d50-ad4f-c2efbcda6725 that also affect it, d2ac4d95-088f-4b4f-8e71-4e526600d197 or other interesting 10e3004e-fe9c-4c1b-9a17-aa5aaad43813 considerations like compiler stuff. a4ce2567-ba9b-4dba-b8a9-b61ffa188b09 Here is the paper. d54a0f8d-505a-48f5-806b-5d4b0f5f8c3b Let's jump to the proposed wording. c37d5117-9253-437a-945d-3e34899004c4 So what's being added in the ranges c62acae7-9c7c-46f9-a7ad-42127881c388 namespace is a new class stride 02278eda-503c-4c95-8863-6854d46cee65 view specializing enable borrow 6bdb348f-96f6-45e1-9e57-22cbb97867b9 range for it and then a stride fbb90bb4-dc1e-4787-b2f1-d4873f3ffd70 object in the views namespace. ed300fb8-d639-46b4-aadc-1c30ac426a15 Hurting for it, 2f31b6bc-d6c6-48c9-a8d2-80404997a09d this advances over N elements at a time. 3ec20e9e-2d00-481e-9cb6-70c64b498bd3 So basically, 56a17e6b-0dfb-444a-8e06-dd002a27f797 if you have a range of elements you can ff2387a1-95f2-49f0-9156-008ea9c6eee8 say I want to look at every other element, 0cc1dbfd-486e-41b9-94cd-dcd23616e71f every third element here. 3fa42cc3-1e42-4ace-8b20-0a5e15cea9de They've got an example. 9780412a-50f8-4cfa-8e10-c409164dc2f6 If you have a views iota 364ba958-e256-46c4-9a36-17c59d5885f3 that counts from zero to 12, 67c7fa97-3b0c-42ee-a551-4880e3c72b76 I believe exclusive. 05592a96-1946-4031-8c73-b3a7c5cc24a3 You could look at every third 238a4ff0-c02d-416f-b609-57e9f1b597fa element and this will print 0369. d8827715-2aa6-4843-b878-d9dd58ef02a6 If you stream that to a no stream. b7492b96-f180-4264-8637-22d9743d133f Or you could also do it in review reverse. c449da8c-cc40-4572-93af-7d58ad7f9c53 So this is a nice way to skip. 3f468ba0-bb6e-476e-a708-130eca2c210f Elements if you ever need that, 3087da4e-191d-47b2-bc90-58f1c62b4f0e so looking at the class definition here, 22ccd406-6e06-4411-916d-0fb51d4257e3 this looks very much like other bca3843c-84a6-4495-bc5a-71dbe518a2a8 views we have. 1c3e3ca1-5f51-4bb5-9106-60df7726e182 I'm sort of just quickly scanning d5182087-3b36-4922-8537-1c721524d6e2 for anything that is unusual or 8510298e-079f-46c9-a846-281bc86ef0f2 unusually different from other b1ef9da5-0f3b-436b-9d75-c5e4ecd1b891 views that I've seen. ee103d0d-e787-4549-8481-9f12f150ec23 OK, so there's some drafting f86ea0ff-50fe-4adc-a54a-2b04ef16e084 notes about end computing missing. 5bd61146-6f7d-47e4-806a-4b4d1ebccb22 OK. And then the stride view 0239f87b-52b4-412b-9448-b4078d924f86 also comes with an iterator, 00947081-b31a-446a-8c91-b3fcdb13f019 so we're going to have a nested iterator. 3dd50fbb-b505-44be-9265-cdf50d4606bd This is also a very common pattern f60442d2-976b-473f-a8bb-b11f06baf463 that we've seen in other views. 0eae0334-dbeb-4af3-bdcd-f1c95b8127f6 A lot of machinery here, 3a00f4f7-af19-4a82-ba88-e876569aa653 because this could be up to 70c322b9-a84b-49cd-9ff5-4e560c47d1d5 a random access iterator. a4b3c244-92e7-433c-a83d-dae4886e1829 Essentially, if you have a vector 817214ff-ee65-40e0-9a0b-74c38d788f6c of a million elements and you're 07d1dd9d-3737-4806-8678-532b0e06887e skipping every other element, c727727c-3868-4905-ad02-d8106904fac0 you can totally say I want to advance ed92412d-0385-424b-9953-f517fc488233 by 100 places and the stride view 197bed00-ce0d-482a-bc09-5e75096a6b74 iterator will know how many times to advance. 799b6848-0e21-4e68-8839-8c51b26ad311 Underlying iterator. 2710cfee-aa53-40e4-9e81-07a8f0e467f0 Uh, kind things about the iterator concept. f8e1413d-467e-45c9-9a90-f382b9159cdb I'm also trying to think of d87efdd9-c51c-4964-9654-8a75c03a5e5a any LDG issues or other papers 8bce822f-eb78-4233-aecf-2059f024b6ff that could interact with this. 32f67da4-9a41-41cd-a875-934d812800d1 I'm not thinking of any that would be 5eab0c10-181a-4be9-ae96-49ce3a277591 concerning and then future to macro. b0dbfa54-e204-42e4-a4da-2fac6bc75d0b OK, so I don't see anything too surprising 6ea983b3-29d9-43a3-9372-a0298a63779e or scary in the paper, which is good. ac348f41-bb08-411b-9306-c2c9911f480b So let's start reviewing the PR. ff8363e4-e834-4300-8924-b8de4eb898d3 I'll keep this open for a second. 8d0aa28e-a0a7-418a-9cf8-c87c0ce7d09b Let me split this. cea1347a-4c28-44d8-9d14-11ef427547e1 So that's the left that's to the right, OK? b7e0b28c-5e9a-46b1-8141-40e2272b3398 So files changed. d5ecd8f5-a8c5-4c72-b07a-55403c669b53 Let's alt click and minimize everything. 1326b15e-bdd8-4e23-8532-9fa9f71436c0 OK, so small. bfa08a39-5e6b-4321-becd-d66c05298320 Changes first we've got in our center 33ac7f58-d76a-4ce6-b814-17b1604382a4 and turn ahead of rivals Core H. 6a372837-0963-4a46-9d8f-9c1efe49769f The new features being mentioned b4e563d2-af18-4b26-bd8c-bc3e4b05a632 under C + 23. 1e41c157-e18a-4134-9531-2741b07b4dcb That's correct. eac8ff57-1406-44fc-af03-7dfec7d1f4ea Make sure the paper numbers correct. 124de9a6-6fae-4d0e-9b60-23fbac99169d 1899 R 3 views, 0a27fe50-baa9-450f-b2b7-94d4d54bcc3c double colon stride excellent. c9e5c8b3-ec79-4079-8fc3-617e8f8ac8b9 It is in sorted order. f83ab5b1-5394-4621-ad49-5e6082f3a235 The only 818 hundred series paper so far. 20accbe3-c816-4e38-9d42-7cf9183e3ec1 We're also gaining a feature test macro. 7b68170b-78ab-48a6-8b95-9d6bf3b1f7d7 Let's make sure the spelling is correct. 6be20b5d-272f-4e02-bb01-b326bc381de1 There it is. 3ada854f-b059-4c8a-ab25-b000905cdedc It is. 81b42d22-ba0f-4794-8c25-eb5cf16f9a84 Let's make sure it's in the right section c7e17117-1b56-40cd-9296-875f3fa69471 in the C + 23 section it's guarded by. 77d2fe70-9384-4526-9098-b3f07ff48747 CP Lib concepts. 72a5a638-b371-4db4-b8a7-4ddbcdbc91f6 Because it's a ranges paper, 6ad89ad9-8a8d-44d1-89b3-adf76370d2da this will eventually evaporate once a0cf42a8-0f14-45e2-aca6-978023e0ccce all of our supported front end support bc0dd44b-e883-4573-98ea-06c1fd3f35ea concepts and the macro value looks correct. 3a1bbbee-3485-41d3-b290-2c10f873de68 Yep, 4fcb56a3-b454-4862-bc4b-d300184e9600 there it is and it is in sorted order. 2a74c27a-6c9c-44e0-a2e9-ff4eb16f3bd4 STA and then STR perfect. 7d49818a-0696-4882-8411-fb25c295dede OK, nothing else to do there. 50004972-57b0-4c26-b270-33d8f7b493ce A feature test macro test is being updated. 3bd2664a-fa8f-4350-aea3-6393fff40d9a New. Macros being mentioned everywhere. 2a45f5bc-12b1-454b-bb57-2fd74f302160 Value we got a typo. b35c239b-4658-4b36-8c29-32b280635097 This looks to have been retyped and 5530c3d6-60a8-4d44-89be-d8038e49ec62 we got a 2021 so this is an issue. 5801bb64-e226-4525-9935-5f639cb5cb35 This is why I always search because maybe, a4df05a5-6304-45fe-906f-6d265c0f1b27 uh, 3% of the time we find an issue here. 1ec0d560-35e1-448d-af6b-5e61788b5ee6 Hippo this value should be blocked. 8847edd3-1f00-49ef-85a5-bbf370b0514a There we go.

It's already approved. 2f6d7655-0a3b-459d-99f9-8b6a4fb63ba4 It's enhancement. e5101e1c-4bd6-4ca8-b1d7-56d6a5edd223 Here it is. 1218d287-903a-4bae-b22b-e7893ec97564 Let me just go into the PR and grab bbd24f1d-a386-4366-99c8-3cafb2299603 the appropriately fixed lines. 96727d9f-420e-4f4d-b805-7c63d6bf678a Yeah, so for consistency, da09392c-3b3c-47ba-a68f-889d252ff2df we're now going to guard these ba9e7457-1753-4abe-b839-07314955f350 with if we're in 23 mode and 4d554901-efb9-4bbc-80a5-976a6a96b448 CPP Lib Concepts is available, 461c100c-6a0e-4040-825c-231da79c7c35 and then we cite the tracking issue just ab91b651-01e7-40d2-a579-fa269aaf1417 so that we have a single way to test for. fd7276a5-27c7-4c44-9980-a7d4f63209f8 Are we in concepts mode. 1fc15dcd-f7d6-4ba1-b12b-9638db167d19 We had, like both ways scattered a7aff000-7433-4888-96e6-fc2615810bee throughout the code base, 797dfbce-f743-436b-a6e2-f5fb6a832887 and it was increasingly confusing, so I will. 657f553c-5f48-4b35-8b7d-b8d5b1ff2039 Add this here. Let's see. e4a806f2-bbd4-4290-b204-b7acf0f8e3cf OK, and then we want. 1a0551bd-2146-4c63-96f7-4a1c602c39a9 Let's make sure we get the right line. da337c3a-e7bc-4b56-a9d3-2a2bb5810c0a Yes, it's a 23 line. 61652b34-c328-42cf-8847-308d768ceda4 I certainly don't want to 7a8c6bc6-a398-4a8e-9272-ede3fc073784 suggest the wrong change, f7fad610-49ca-41bd-8f47-a2315f05a857 but I can make a suggestion 24749e36-1275-401b-a9e3-bc25fd6f74f3 here and justice replace this. e83a9c53-254a-4b31-a70b-9818d0edba53 Then we can actually look at the edit. fd1b65fc-780b-4851-afdb-dd0ac1f6afe4 Yeah so keep CXX 23 UM and changes that. a58aa217-ee71-4319-8d05-2c97bb5e5cdf Yeah, that looks good. 765b9018-07d5-4028-add0-477a7b6d5473 Let's see. 19e8cac5-85ec-4c90-8cc2-c23bb55e2250 Let me explain this properly, OUM. f08f70ee-e7b8-4e88-ba75-ac5d4a480e5d This is consistent with the. a9fc99d1-6134-48a3-8bc9-7e59cb760292 Current state of the file, but my. ER is, uh? afea30c1-055e-450d-9975-610c5b4538de Overhauling the. Umm? Hattern 339b12ac-b6c7-4f83-884f-eb62f491b1c6 is UM. be9687d5-713b-443b-8d72-5a4d60404c0d Changing these lines. 04f2ebf3-b36e-4f0d-87dd-533499d5b376 But it's actually not accessed with f6076d5e-113e-42ee-9962-26fa48eabac2 the current state of the file, c5fba6a3-9844-4e73-88e2-feef0e0841a1 because the file is inconsistent. 190e9fe3-be33-474b-8231-fbe401837b36 Let me rephrase that. cadd7948-e616-48b7-adae-d80fad0f7b0f This is considered, yeah, 6a4fa665-a0f6-4238-9180-c745b79705ba it's I'm trying to not spend a8daf6b4-a862-4522-9641-721d73e2448c too much time on this, 6f10f9c9-2bc5-4470-a8a2-9ab9151d7c92 but I do want to at least 5cf9e4af-6a8e-454c-a530-4b2054069d0f provide a correct explanation. 4ba4ea65-0ce1-4343-abb7-56485d70f89f This is consistent with the occurrence above, fd7c7b5c-7c95-47bf-bef6-d2c961fc83ce but my PR blah. 86975f8a-173c-429f-a753-a5fd834149da Is changing these lines to be globally 8a5708e9-62fd-4f9f-90be-758bff123cd0 consistent to avoid a stealth merge conflict? 52bdf1ae-e1ea-4205-8791-4ada7c609184 Actually we should just say thus. 65d3d576-1cd3-45fe-84e6-828b4fbdbee0 This should. Be changed to. 7bbb6ace-7ce0-4ab2-a9c9-0f19a4bb465b OK. That's that look, 1494f812-d634-44b5-8689-610f471a71ba this is consistent with the current above, c182cee3-2c81-47aa-a384-42c92a2d13d5 but my PR 2994 is changing these efc75297-9d1c-4b22-85af-5e5a781633e6 lines to be globally consistent. edff1eb0-71ba-4885-9476-9e9c4f7f1d4a Thus this should be changed to still 23, 6d4a15ba-9688-43cc-af44-c421d162b273 but test concepts and site OK. e7519cb8-b327-45a4-bf66-3b5a0f17454c Do you want to make the previous 288d67cc-7e50-4040-aac5-e7067472a392 comment suggestion as well as opposed 7d5d2499-4310-4451-a1f8-1435407ccbd0 to saying type of this value should be? c3858e8f-d190-4723-a8ca-67a9a3023d27 The typo oh this year. fa8f0865-32f3-4e88-b6a5-2cf9210742eb Ohh yeah I could I could just 2db2eaf6-787c-429c-ae96-9f87f10a427e make a suggestion. 759a3bf4-2820-4d69-8895-44d581dcbe78 I could definitely do that. 818ac454-6e89-459c-9f02-f82fcf591774 Typo. Hey, how come I don't get the. 31439ee7-f003-4c65-ad7f-e3a473c51ced Suggestion thingy?

Yeah, f547f4ef-ead9-414c-8909-74134a20fc80 I I suspected like it does seem like a bug. 00cd7597-7f8c-47ea-ac68-776f8d27ab30 I don't know if it's a bug or by design, 0611a56c-3852-4790-87a8-1601bcb78107 but I am lazy. OK, there we go. 2b1fb8e9-fde2-4139-93cc-e0804c6cd950 Yes, and I was going to say typo, 8327eabb-17a9-4165-bc43-821023d6e685 but I think that's clear in context. 3057cec8-6f9d-4ec7-959a-061a83aec1db OK. Thanks. 5b16e876-e26e-4ae1-8458-91503306322a OK, that looks like it for the future. c47acd87-7343-4174-87e7-ec51b8ef8007 Just back to test, uh, ffcfdd6a-f5c1-4d35-bcf5-8c3d709d79e2 we now have two new tests being added. cc0f62bb-3c9d-4e0d-ac99-25f282bd3cd0 I'll quickly check this one for test that 7bdc17d8-c0e6-41af-8aa1-e9d1e61754c0 it works and other tests that runtime cbdd4576-64be-456d-a2de-412899134a1c checks will terminate the program. 45a548b2-3a54-40e7-8530-476c681572ad So we are citing the correct 63428781-0a86-412c-bbb4-72db497be1e0 paper number 189903. 840305c2-c1c0-47ee-bf97-ffcbf219e456 It's in sorted order. 06637a12-9e54-4e94-8f0d-c50d3c9c7427 I want to make sure that the tests 8057ff55-1ce4-4675-a4fb-b2574200eb05 are spelled exactly the same, 47803ee8-4dc2-4ebd-af54-22fe0fbb7f21 because this is only checked 1944fd54-516f-4636-a20b-dcc36d5168d4 in the internal test harness. d7396c5f-be4c-46b0-8805-528e19b95f1a Yep, that all looks good. d4eaeb41-e08b-4b36-b749-050dd6bfc095 So tests are being added to the list. 8ea48b13-a2ba-42e6-b9b3-7d6f09001174 Excellent, 703f9e31-dd47-4b24-b423-d14afcf0bd6b I've got our copyright license banner. ca4c8405-3d32-4c25-a68a-892a6b629184 Uh, because it's ranges. b7046c7a-abcb-4a07-b84a-e04eaa5b0ae6 We need strict and concepts. b4dd096a-d14d-4109-b92c-94d59184ff9f It's a C + 23 feature, so it's latest matrix. 1428ca40-e9e5-468e-a8da-e0e930be5294 Yep, so that's all our good compiler options. c155f3b0-ca9e-43a9-ae1e-7e21a1191215 Same here. 7d2162dc-7756-40e0-b01a-147cdbddf35a Strict concept slaves matrix with our banner. 4dfb7d1f-e953-43a6-9fe4-dc5f86cfaa18 Ohh, quickly look. 7a9bbae7-4384-4cda-9274-90010d5c95ae This we got the banner OK, 42bc4d51-71a1-4a15-92d6-a3d6160e4f34 I'll review the test later and 0ab0b3ea-567c-464c-9f41-ceaf0a3dd2fb then here it's a large diff. b62951da-c403-4065-b4b2-32fa7623f50f 700 lines or 600 lines. 10754b4a-c9db-4a32-8214-4dc516e4e0ce Copyright license banner. 3ee93db5-4834-4c1e-8a77-79c9982c7963 OK, we'll come back to this. cfe9022c-05c4-429e-b64c-17441f4552e0 Let's look at. e8e424a8-752c-4466-ae7b-02e74b217c53 The Natfiz and the product code. 45062e25-7b9d-48f8-bb66-91ef2b1e5742 OK, 640faddd-b1b4-4838-9a25-8a7e3038391e so this is going to need to 85a5813a-4666-4831-b33a-60ee2300ddff be triple mirrored over to VI. 4406285a-bce8-488f-a2ed-ee5a4104b1b7 Think we're currently In Sync 56ebc8ea-724f-4da9-879a-007bef7f2dc4 with all the visualizer changes, caeba7ae-8374-400f-b2e6-8ca2465c9cf3 so this will just need to be 110273ed-e47d-4416-a37b-db3176e6c977 mirrored in isolation. c8180e3f-f333-44ee-8c5d-763a92d7ba6c I think it is reasonable to a3805127-e82f-4ef6-b6a9-f4047dd17714 do this as part of the PR, 5c7578b9-415e-4df4-b4ba-257a216cc9c1 so we're going to add strive b9c5a320-b61a-45cb-b9d7-5e56c62f73e1 view with all these views. 9687bdf5-4709-4660-9c7d-6c56ce79a114 There's been no real attempt to sort them, 771ec1f7-c979-4db9-b528-018d6364d2cb so appending to the end is fine. 37bff0ef-8ce7-48d1-b3ef-46a7aed3137c And then we have an optional 46aa6708-fdf2-4156-9afc-a4c10006453b data member called the stride. 7a6613c9-673c-48f9-b240-7456cf6e17f0 I do want to make sure that this is 682ee52d-e80a-4d71-9c47-151400d94eb4 actually occurring in the product code. e8afddc0-15f6-4259-bb08-6d31d8b68361 So. c7fbc942-94e0-491b-b6f8-5bffa8f9077a Look for occurrences of under bbe59ec5-5aed-4eb2-81fd-fa01f9f88fed score capital structure, 1dcbf9db-88c8-4e87-8432-1def192edd1b period. 60ba2d6c-2b67-450a-8c03-cb14858bbea4 It's going to be a data b7b541bf-4f4d-4382-8e82-a9c5ede9ee26 member of Stride View. f4d64a97-956e-467a-b9d8-0ccf096cb72f Where is it?

OK, aaa3bae3-6d20-4b6d-b061-6ad8cea9b780 so it is called under score capital stride. 7c7b4a89-7dae-42aa-8336-9ebbba45a831 This looks great. 521f5e45-258b-4988-a744-4ea72d6ad576 OK, I will make a note that e53f9f89-0e1c-474f-9f01-ee84836ef386 we do need to mirror this. 9e08dbd0-424e-485e-87df-66de8d258e37 I'll just note it on an empty 11a19335-a259-49b7-9b5d-220e1a7481a3 line because it's not an issue 1e882746-cc8d-473a-a61c-02f192a24f7e with any of the code above. 26d6c475-a5a7-46a6-9677-9d2ecb239769 Note, Umm well need to. aa2ff06f-d69b-43a4-af9d-a0d9027f5ed0 Triple mirror this to the VSS internal 9834a113-8f80-41d1-8810-3aa1b6eac50f repo where the visualizers are stored. c22dd11c-9444-4a67-af32-0ec4e5c509f6 OK.

All the way. 0c1d132b-1953-4e39-9b4b-0fa4c54c3e29 We already looked at the feature to macro. 78be2992-b47c-4232-b4c1-d9ebe16a6b1c OK, backup capture. 0d2cc582-64b1-4dda-bb80-325fdd56da4c Get a larger pen, OK? 14264ffb-bbc5-442e-b8a2-9d4de6260839 OK, there we go. Umm, so ranges? efeb8fef-531c-4325-b5d4-6ec8966bbe11 Uh, we've got stride view and. cd023e62-a70d-419d-87d0-0b30cc9da0a8 OK, this is the class declaration. e6b9cb77-f108-4aca-8e8f-8dba5b104b47 The question is, is it b8559e45-036a-412d-b797-3d3f601191b8 occurring in the correct place? 647d20a5-a507-4f96-ae0d-e45a924c9690 Because we try to keep them in a7e7ab3b-3378-4324-8c61-1cb74efc1e62 the same order as the standard. ab126116-6244-4c09-8162-2c5db36c750d This doesn't actually say 5c021fdf-9157-4538-b3cf-63dc067db42a where it should be added. a386cab3-816e-4fb4-a033-b375cd3f327b So the editors could choose 540f6093-1d61-491e-86f5-f0bc8a267d85 wherever interesting we will hope fcdf3c14-0bd9-4e08-8ce5-3a8a39610709 that they choose the same place. 5a6288fb-6941-41c6-a8e4-fb3f70793dbc In fact, this even just says 7abee026-9b09-474f-a031-ba2a914f79b9 add the following subclause, 786fed0f-383e-4f22-96eb-67426cac231e which implies that it's 32037d80-4911-4e43-a3f7-25ec68f0c3f2 just going to be appended. a8cf034e-d102-464b-bd2a-8020eb0bace2 I suppose we could look at the 86b305bc-ab8d-4be1-ba3f-66197b24ad32 current order of the subclauses, 0507fa32-5d3d-4e3e-9b78-c287375d73a3 I'm assuming chunk by is f11b9a70-2a6b-413a-8740-95a5c38f18e2 probably one of the last. 9a3c8c47-9006-4b17-8fdf-0088a1793564 OK, so it's 24 two range of sin 42c32a86-5c74-4509-9050-66519c740e30 and then 24/7 range adapters. 454e2a9b-f1d8-4829-9323-65083fad73d1 OK, so like 24/7 I can't be right. a75b7c51-3ef0-4830-b3b0-11e1f93504dd Might be 20. Ohh, did the clauses 9f5b54cd-249c-4a19-91be-157681893bf9 the clauses might have got renumbered ed0fc2bb-ddd1-4558-afe4-2d4f331de793 between when this paper was initially 72d86c11-e3f4-4176-bd13-6c79fc4b45b3 submitted so fairly low number. 2a804e53-eb83-4e38-970d-c03c2ee9935a So I'm probably looking at the wrong section. ad00ebff-15c1-4414-b0d4-bc340f7751c1 Where is ranges 26. 7 range it out. OK, f46ff73f-d4bd-41de-b6c2-1510eb58ad6a so the numbers in the proposal are outdated, 5b15c9e9-4c19-455b-adec-f1051cea4e4f but indeed chunk by view is the last one. ceecd1db-dbac-482f-ba1b-a741cd621b1c So pending. OK, so this does f7a9b5e2-eb0d-4899-be85-4b439bb33076 seem to be in the right place. 1e5f8c6b-5711-485f-bab1-d82cff6813e9 So we got the stride view. 41311fc0-b67c-4e60-87f7-fbd2c01bc6a9 Uh, let's look at. 63f9ceba-0082-403c-aa66-d813fefa9d84 Interesting, this does not match. d3ac1ce9-91d3-4c5b-9044-d76ec2f86832 This is template on oh, 69a02952-c4c2-4729-9dfa-f3ddb68186da I see it's being reversed. 77f0e39d-7f85-410a-a3c8-cd8741563b30 OK, let's actually look at the. 3a91980b-e16b-4e9c-822c-339e496a6cc6 Definition here. af752b84-3e7e-41f6-973e-df3559f83108 OK so this is being reversed. a0dc251a-2a3c-4b53-a3c4-c54012175e11 The proposal depicts template on an 2b3d6f5f-c0ad-463c-838a-95124038c9d1 input range V that has to be a view. d20f0b3b-2d64-4ff4-b46d-61dcc3e34a5d This definition says template on a 4d5b32de-9534-483a-880e-9ef28b4740b0 view V that needs to be an input range. 02c3ea97-f880-4f72-a1e6-c00ad3220ceb And then drive public afc739f7-2728-44b3-bb06-437523b9fc70 interface drive view view. 5e94ca60-0ae5-498a-a43b-46d83b058bff OK, this arts all fine, ef500243-dc07-4dd5-b3e1-d89087c5a452 but the reversal here is interesting. 4942dd7f-e33e-47a1-bde7-0907a7be8a04 What does again? d8bddb58-0923-4260-b645-12bf27ac8ccf I'm looking at the wrong thing. 7540ec8c-36cf-438b-a61a-36f049d2c9b7 Uh, what does something like 8d13982d-aea6-4398-a5e5-434e898c3208 chunk by view look like? 2887cfd6-2be0-40db-bf44-bfe59b860563 Chunk by view is templated on a375bdd9-65a2-4197-9fae-09d7661a20ca a range that requires view. 14fdb737-48f4-4be7-a6af-f968386236b5 So the standard is quite consistent d1578868-bcbd-49df-8d5b-1a577628ab2b template on the range require view. ea3391e9-40a0-4a93-862d-555ea0b33771 And this is just reversing it. 8fde469d-1efd-4e2b-b2bb-4854fca239f8 And let me look at our implementation. 6db6eeb8-a4a7-4caa-9999-0e323518e47e Again, I can look at chunk by view e04ecddc-9228-4b27-9dec-534600d73c4a for precedent since it's above. 2efc1baa-3b0d-42cf-a573-413b8b1844f4 Here it is. That's pretty big. ef9097d3-7a66-4a9f-939c-20315befc735 Again, template on range requires view. 1db253d8-75ca-4b76-91e6-8f5f650d304e I think this should be reversed. 62d280a6-2b22-4aae-91b9-f28e13c35821 It may not actually make a difference. 690e38e6-26c8-4245-bb8c-19b4a012752b But it really seems that we should 75819f38-90a0-4fb9-b7a4-b0d250ea1706 be following the standard here, bad9e368-fadd-4bac-a361-2654e0ea1ce1 unless there's a good reason to do otherwise. a759a8e7-2ae6-4741-b858-3b5955922db6 Yes, OK so. e106b8d3-d185-42f0-a88f-2669f8365ed9 Uh, let's see. ba9cbaf3-29c9-4f8a-b9d2-a3637fec9a2f The. Proposal depicts. Umm? e41e232d-5d2d-434e-90f3-9f82360af1c6 Templates on. Input range V. a640e5ba-81ae-44f9-af50-fe34911eb881 That's then constrained by requires. 02e67704-3620-496c-aa15-91e80f9a1873 View TV. Umm? I, I think I might 1ec6d3d7-444b-40a0-96ae-0c574d88887e know why this person did this. 5c323021-793c-46e8-9bd5-5263183266ec Can you look at the other, the non 55a5a711-7335-4c0b-8478-89b00f61a022 input or the stronger than input range? cc660187-cff7-4c7a-b25e-950ebbc874b0 Version of Strife view. 71690c9b-884d-4a83-b284-bfce79c5dc04 Is there 10 the specialization? c9c3c1d9-96e6-40b2-943b-3cb4c0da6097 OK yeah. Do we have a whole? f95af5b0-80f8-4371-a652-d1a4bbd7b141 We do not have a whole 1baccfdd-c254-45a4-ad92-a0e2d3f850bb specialization of stride view. b5bc3063-1b3b-4d89-9973-794e734c1cad Oh, there's only primary specialization, 184df8bd-acc5-4e55-b8e0-9c01bc127d2f in which case it makes 8f1c36f1-f04f-4b15-83c6-54a6657d5415 sense to make view the. c466019f-9440-4693-b363-c8528236423d Primary concept, but if there's b2bceefb-da35-49c2-9e4e-5f069e42f732 not an extra specialization there, 6e1ec171-4027-48e5-a34b-954a7e1d94af it doesn't make any sense. e819cc2f-8f85-46b9-b9d9-5ca75b0e33b8 Yeah, the iterator operators are cc9f9a10-a346-4470-9974-040e317c624e things that are like constrained f1442888-fb4a-4540-af2f-076111e87542 with requires the base needs d0b01789-4887-4fdf-9535-bd58e0135cd5 to be a random access range, 726e8ac1-737a-47e5-9ca9-9e73387c189f but that's at the iterator level. d01fb926-6513-482a-9976-ba6536023377 Yeah, I think they should be reversed. OK so. e1c09271-5b00-4758-b51f-bba31f9bdde7 We should follow that here. e3183bc1-a60e-47a4-8d8f-d9b1a2de04f9 Unless there's a good reason to do. 9c9f359f-ee75-451b-9e3d-e931757a6927 Otherwise, OK. The proposal depicts ab07a628-709d-42af-847a-8c12d74bba49 template on input range V that's ed83e2d9-9b53-4721-966b-869d145721ce then constrained by requires V. 291db47d-0b81-4ea7-a21e-69d95dbc99c7 We should follow that here unless ee732e31-57ba-4152-b742-0a039fd761c1 there's a good reason to do otherwise. 99027286-d98d-43ed-920b-5959f74bb3b8 OK. OK, so if we reverse those 4ccc809e-a7df-4168-8850-d3ad8816685c we get a template on input a22e4b2e-10da-4ffa-8fa9-a081459d28d1 range view requires view view. 12cb307b-1152-4042-8485-227bfecefe2f Class stride view Dr publicly eb907a84-bb3f-4b81-83bd-1b2ef6b9fc95 from view interface drive. 8a96a4b9-8bf2-432e-bf3a-6c7f26f5c9c1 View view. OK so that looks good. 388c1a7f-5197-47cf-bc85-a6300ed8d023 And we are definitely within ranges. 2091abc4-667f-48ef-84ec-f363085c9405 We're outside views. 15100d9c-7763-46b7-93e1-0ec06af19507 OK, so private data members. a43c5366-5616-4cfa-a71d-f5c58e02b106 Uh, comment out no unique address 127b2cfa-8d65-46d5-8440-220acab792f1 because we can't actually use that yet. 3bd45cbf-3b91-48b8-bdd7-b75ce13d0de7 View range, so that's the base, and then cadd8f49-4676-45d0-994b-1f7ef512dc4a we're going to have a range difference. bd0f1058-a581-41af-8358-46adfbf9a7d2 T view stride OK, these are exposition only. 75813cdb-2681-4fa3-b441-2505da0ac15f We're going to have an iterator. fa46be45-33ab-457c-b7f5-ed1937f4f2ce So that's this and this. 33701752-8d17-47bd-8c85-8ce63648b67b We're going to have a template on 44411004-9176-4782-a5d8-86c81bd1fdf5 class based high class iterator base. d322a42c-ecea-4382-80c3-05603374acb3 Uh, template for a forward range a69c477f-7153-43a8-89c7-73633bbe7c09 based tie plus iterator base. 16fac4c7-58e6-48cc-8a02-cc764d259dfc Specialized on base time private 74002381-1e0a-4a49-b188-4b5c3b4503c0 using base category. 860fc5d7-eb9d-49cf-a60b-cdd97bdc5492 OK so this is going to implement 19f9bd96-8db1-490f-b2e7-57fc2ef6fb18 some of the category stuff down here. d302c216-94c0-4845-a943-87bc2567cf91 Let me see if I can find that. c2270ff9-4f89-480b-83b8-a447463fba68 Here we go. The iterator concept. 14d10b06-8349-4589-bd57-a5b417bdf102 That's iterator concept. 1889bcf3-4f0c-4986-8973-3d0a35d98435 Here's iterator category. OK. 6ce3de87-5ec5-424e-a971-b9f889400d29 So the member type of name iterator category. a34abb2a-c52f-42e2-a5a6-fc4cf7896641 Here it is is defined if and only 4c099e97-7103-4d3a-b060-2c963838d689 if base models forward range. e48d54fa-506f-4a55-b7d9-07ce9447fc9e There's the forward range and in that eaac4c92-e2a3-4562-963d-dc014358699d case iterator category is defined as follows. 83837dc1-8ea5-4950-836d-6bb93061c8b8 Let C denote the type iterator traits 5ab0a071-bf83-4c8c-9d6c-ce5283115656 iterator to F base iterator category. de21aab6-7af4-4818-a7a6-7dd175433c38 So iterator traits iterator T of base 60f0d910-174d-4cb9-9304-c4afe5b015ef iterator category. We need type name. 52877737-b7ca-47bf-bbcb-35bbfd7927ef So using base category. 8a933bc6-9b22-46b1-b319-2502d402779e OK, that's reasonable. a9db5926-759f-4df1-ad7f-2c574060c900 And then publicly we're going 72868e67-eaed-4dbd-a933-aea98687aa8c to say and then this is OK. 6b08fc37-4464-47cf-84b6-1c1c3d98ff72 It's not too long. 970370cc-7314-4fd3-9e74-1ffec601ce36 Umm, af78c921-1534-43cd-bc23-71f3351c8f99 if C which is that type based 2b4b996d-6646-4ab5-9657-792f05ffe0ee category models derived from 0127e64b-fe88-49c8-beef-d3bfb47de9ed random access iterator tag. 7d23d123-f8a9-4b3f-b624-38768b17f07e So if base category is derived 08bca052-1f38-4c25-ac53-f674752e3109 from random access iterator be438426-fc8b-44eb-9627-c46bbdac7006 tag then conditional it should 99b683f2-f1da-4bdc-838d-86e7f5b189fa be random access iterator tag. 4cd96aa0-7fb4-4b3a-8bfe-e0ac8128b9e7 Yep otherwise it should be C base category. 513151c8-9547-4b3a-86e4-9967c272c685 Yep, that looks exactly right, c70dda46-3305-4a40-a9f1-d20c8f27baf2 so this is implementing. 6f7c6b00-8cc0-4171-8330-86824057a6d5 This stuff. OK, so this is all done. 139481c3-9ebe-4013-876d-1833862aa556 And then we've got iterator, 647ba13b-5652-4cb1-96cc-b26802668f0c so that's a peer. f931ee65-b491-452d-bcce-7befb37ab8fb OK template on a bool which 2eaabe8d-73cc-4dd0-b1bc-c5658ca3088b is going to be constant. 9a7c0f8e-7ed2-466b-a1ae-92e27cf0615d Constant class under score capital iterator. 7217d366-046d-4366-aebc-02bf009d2a36 It's ugly because it's exposition b37777bb-add4-4a86-bcdc-d7dd1400b43d only drives publicly from the 6a589ba6-4ab8-4ccb-a25b-3906eb7afde1 iterator base of maybe constant view. 35dab809-8492-47bd-9706-45f4ea3f6689 OK so apply constant to the view. 3fddc4f3-e98d-41c0-b54d-167e5f0cf909 OK. So that looks correct. f5a17aaa-4a7f-4244-a75a-df05083e3b0a And then let's actually look 2374a6a5-7a65-4bd9-b0ac-8652b6f2e981 at what's that's doing. b92b1573-0f97-41b5-af6a-7e2c44dc3287 It's going to be down here. ffedbeb5-a5fa-4da7-929a-4946ed5ebfda OK, so we've already seen 6b4e3b9f-917c-4ae6-bc5d-19a517e6adeb this is the outer class. 8d4fa7bb-9c38-4d39-919a-9d06b3b4eae8 We've already commented on 3aa1fab4-2705-4e57-ac5e-ef8752f2b93f that O template on Vulcans. a4d1d9ba-14b6-40ee-8e75-102c78afc6fe This is a stride view iterator. e90c9da3-68d1-46d2-877c-ee0e7d46a8fc And then we get that type def. d7f5e2f8-2083-4184-b66f-3a296b46f1a0 OK, so that base class isn't depicted using 789f46a8-57f3-4e47-a4d4-9d7199c5a2eb parent is maybe constant stride view. 2032b660-625f-4be0-9c7f-b3c6692fe093 OK, so that's going to be this here. 06242e5d-6c18-4687-b8a6-32019e58ce54 OK, so let's see private. f230fff5-3685-411f-aa78-bbdd9d34d8fb We grant friendship. 4abd87d4-e984-434b-92fb-f67267ff81d4 To the stride view. d5e5c0c1-4f32-4b0e-8f8a-b2e8753478f5 Is that necessary? 87f886eb-1d6b-4a1b-8780-675eea97f77e Yes, because as an iterator it can see 682cf4c3-5e1d-4deb-b9f5-8a8b5b560a6e private data members of the parent, f26b878a-d7df-407b-ba21-46ec37d92340 and this will allow the parent 33be508b-2873-46be-80ca-ed831b804dc1 to see private data members and 9b1ac700-aa66-4e34-ae15-fae86e241f55 member functions of the iterator. 5a7bb306-2c90-454e-a7e2-a0b918c0040c Interestingly, this also grants f51ba777-daeb-456d-87ee-86b01c5c8998 friendship to any other nested classes. 2893177b-5346-4728-b3cc-0318be7a5fab I don't think that's going 99646e9c-f75a-46bc-900d-f8374383fbbd to be an issue here, ef003f6b-344f-4cd5-9f3b-fe32e2a1e02b but we have seen that in other types OK, 407a6235-050f-44f7-9c4f-3f37a0bccd54 and this uses the extended front syntax 8e764c56-6f16-400f-a813-a5a574552768 that doesn't say class or anything, 582edd6f-9e18-467f-ae74-670504507b7e so that's awesome. 787d8c27-060e-4da6-9447-ab071739cf99 Avoids potentially declaring anything using 1e0924df-f5fc-4e76-880a-bb31b14f822c a parent tie is maybe constant stride view. 2c5d9ce1-1fe0-4446-8ea9-574175f42787 That's parent, 9f555219-4a4e-4232-9db7-74ccf6f367c7 using bases may be consequences view. b76c2811-2b64-45b2-ad83-b9b410001ac8 Yep, using base iterator 3375f1b3-d1f5-45f3-862a-40234335a955 his iterator to your base. a9d03356-6eb7-41ca-bc6b-96c732c47ace So that's just for our convenience. 922b7817-246a-4194-8427-dd63d9b5e6d9 Using Base Sentinel and Sentinel tea base. 4625d32c-d78d-4c71-8bfd-03362ae3d07b OK, so that's all good. c5cbafc3-30b0-48b3-9795-e3e66a314aed We got this and this. ccef6538-3c88-4e2b-a3b9-2c8121c5a286 Now we're gonna have no unique 97bdba75-35ca-4cc1-9f2c-f698228077dd address because these could be empty. ec379f7d-79ea-4876-a4ca-b232aec39f0e Again, this is for the future. 36700ad6-d5f0-432e-a508-a580f3acb8e8 They're currently commented d92167fb-79e7-44ca-a1fa-bd84c3cc474b out base iterator current. bc07da4d-842e-4ff5-b38b-f63e92988cec And then value initialize it OK and then 4681625f-d904-4e76-b19b-5d571dce3900 based Sentinel end value initialize that OK. 66e3446c-2a38-4140-a13e-f6a1843fa77d Stride is arranged difference tea. 2031c885-0c71-4bc5-a9c3-4c8b83317521 It's initially 0 same with missing. 8551c6b3-e02d-4ede-b387-840682ea5545 OK, so you've got all this. e884e279-1a71-461a-945b-0b4c9011b5a8 And then we're going to have a 9b253212-7886-4792-9175-0165d1fd2547 constexpr constructor for the iterator. 6897853b-0302-4481-b27a-54969310eb2a That's going to take and this c03f6d2f-3e75-4fe0-b009-0b6ad9c41b4e is exhibition only, 4eec8488-dd17-4ea2-819c-0f03392378f2 so it can be private. feaafa9c-dbe5-4d29-8064-43d10122aa02 Parent type star parent. e85ba2cf-8a8d-47ff-9765-4e8b4e2a68cd This is not applying top a45ecf6d-0e9a-4e0a-8456-8ab01447acda level counts to the pointer, 435a24b5-46d2-4af3-89ad-769a892d2ff8 but I'll accept that I'm not too ac93a916-b65f-45c4-b529-8433baf584fc worried when it's fairly small. dbd5247a-4ecf-4dc3-a5cc-4607d9d9d228 Base Iterator current with a 2a4412e8-1b69-43b2-8454-68861f15fb7c following under score so don't 13bc603b-f2f6-443a-9c7a-48b95818383b get any shadowing that's good. 2a2b3502-bc28-4c4c-9ce9-6b570df35c3d That's our usual convention range difference. f332bdee-6656-4a9a-af4b-0ca9d97a826e T base missing. This is occurring. b8fb9e83-777f-4617-86e8-d71cd96d3aa1 At least four times. 19dc8bd9-8f29-4258-a272-83c93ffca55b It is kind of like we could move 6a43ed06-6737-4ff2-8caa-cbae68b1cf37 this up and put different type 3570e48a-16e6-49ca-8abc-31749859d749 above and then just use it. ae5ae866-41f0-43b7-b270-e33cd99e6aa1 It's not too verbose. f156e33b-a42e-4c4c-ab61-a6526d6c5190 I'm tempted, but I won't ask for that change. b805e1a3-a57c-45e0-b319-0fed75504e39 UM, because this is at least d35cc866-946f-42ff-9fa7-0866075cbc9f following the standard, 70a37e81-c434-4aeb-a57a-8da5eae65e83 the standard doesn't bother to provide 8f1e3be8-71a1-47a8-9fbe-76fcc79356ba the different type up until down here. 406f7025-e409-4f16-a334-fa5612935413 Umm, OK so range difference. b9c4e9d0-d12d-4c48-995f-7e58745b7c3f Tea base missing that defaults to zero. b9d70ead-727e-46a0-88e0-53eba164096a OK wrap for clang format? af11d727-ce51-493d-9670-7413f74088e2 We're conditionally no except. b754849d-f4d2-439b-a762-33101e4ce5fa This is common to strengthened, 05dada69-6d9f-4025-9242-91062a3ef188 which is reasonable. f490123d-5c8b-4d5d-aa2d-732de82815f3 It is depicted in the standard, f9077eba-6127-4e45-ba03-f2faa6a0420e even though it's exposition only, f123de05-0f3a-4339-8d05-d9a16878eaa3 so that seems fine. 7edb315b-ab9d-47a6-b71b-9499fd3575a0 We're no, except if this is no fa094c58-abf6-4965-b42c-19b6d722913a except ranges end parent range, 8abe1b3a-88b2-46e9-9804-ae892c15324d because that's where we got a call there, d5c9e069-9d1f-4c2a-9117-cdd9f70bb6f5 and the base iterator needs to be no throw, a2385281-af57-47f5-a121-33fb24e064e2 move constructible because we do f4b8c91c-80cc-4dc5-9436-6d7ccf9439a3 move it and the base Sentinel needs ad7fbb83-4d3f-4ad3-bcf9-6292147bb03b to be known for move constructible. cfdae4fc-8b54-4083-86e2-d3eefce873a4 Yep. OK, that seems exactly correct. 3c78a5ec-e2ea-4525-8657-70add699d314 Current move current under score and ffa7273c-5ac1-45f0-90d6-9e37c6ab585e should be ranges end of the parent range, 3e9e3991-aa29-4fc7-923e-f2b6c1cbd079 stride parent stride missing b0fc5644-8be0-4a0b-846d-39ab0cdea753 is whatever missing. 975a2617-5e19-487a-a327-85a375484c58 They're giving us OK, that's good. 4c7309fb-f6b6-4276-9efb-023abfc9babb OK, now this public using different 45ee63d1-05cf-42fa-94aa-74ced39d5c1a type range difference to base using fed17feb-b0a7-4264-b5ce-46035ba7253e value type range value to base 1a3712f9-24bb-4071-97c3-c9f754fd54d6 using iterator concepts see below. dc83d892-5007-4b8d-97d8-4f0cb7fe4ed8 Let's see below, that's this here. ca4f8356-6358-4798-84ee-9b396b11b246 We've already got the iterator category, 08db5aad-e5ff-48d0-b653-f2a35c064a8d but the iterator concept says if 0e194d5d-4c91-480e-98a2-08f593d79e8e base models random access range, 83dfcfbe-cafe-4304-815c-dd280a68dd06 it should be a random access or A tag. f71f6b23-8601-4568-9b03-8930c1812fb4 If it is a bidirectional range, 8f87dd20-1f5c-4404-befc-102c55b89ba8 then it's the bidirectional iterator tag. 4bcf7f89-402b-44df-b854-baf26e4912f6 If it's forward range forward iterator tag. 28c0c9ac-db52-4ec4-8434-c3e9cc809c75 Otherwise input iterator tag exactly correct. 1b823993-27e9-4215-8103-e6164bae8816 OK, bunch of conditionals. a15bc09e-297a-48d8-abea-f13225f5049e It's all done. 2942ea28-b6d2-46b3-8e97-22956142ecfa And we've already got the iterator e3d929a1-9fa1-4a68-bbec-138005173a01 category coming from the base class, b898c256-94c2-4c5b-8b15-1ca2ccc59353 and indeed it's not always present. 8d35b224-1631-42f3-944b-033fa31c37ee Umm? 14937ca3-7abd-4fa7-b484-ffd40585b8b3 We've got, 930b4ea9-5bb9-41ed-98dc-be1c0a8e3678 yeah, 72878c54-a0aa-4742-aa90-c0e5c9d07444 this is a pattern that Clang format 4098c561-0fb5-487c-9783-92b3e05267f2 currently does not handle well, e9b8bddf-8450-470c-a430-c9d1aead3585 so we suppress it. 6f1c8a11-cb90-471c-88be-06d7c535f501 Here we've got a default constructor 9fb9f681-8b29-4bf7-b644-847be960499f requires default initialize 38fd5283-5170-4183-82b9-86e0fc353b55 table of the base iterator. 57e3f670-f87f-4260-997c-ff474706b171 That's our convenience type. 72bec5b6-0f9c-4d9f-9fe7-28235649f4de Def defaulted, 5bf7ee0e-3a04-4d74-a8e4-85d2dcb4eed1 that's good. 336095b3-bf79-44d9-a92b-c3b937c147e1 And then we have a constexpr constructor from 4b597cd2-38c7-41ab-9ea2-e6cfcb4075b6 an iterator with the opposite constant other. 63d1bda1-850a-4f68-8df0-dd7a166ccf18 And then. aea7e7bc-aa7c-458a-9bc2-321f5b76418a This is being strengthened for noexcept. 9810e46e-3edd-41b9-b8ab-8034bbf05316 Let's check this if the base iterator d681c9e8-17de-4cb8-b99d-e25335a7bcdb is nothrow constructible from. 2bf8af48-7fd2-46a4-a2c0-a3dd9152fff8 Iterator to fu. cff72a8f-c9f0-4983-a76b-66ae568095c1 That is what we're trying to do, 1e980168-ca45-4c12-92fc-4110bc73f5e8 convert here. 6836fa92-4e12-4c49-af3d-da5130c5a233 If my base iterator is ohh because this 03e21f64-b635-4649-abe5-97d0ffdc5063 only occurs when I'm consed and the 70355e4e-40e9-4d2d-8cd8-61ef475a3ac6 other iterator is not consed O iterator. dc711232-50b6-4c34-a8d1-1562b0d84aec Tofu is the others iterator in that case. 9fc1a88b-70c2-418e-ac9b-e2b56f914b03 So this is correct. 63f5be5d-6c6d-4c31-ac11-f46fcb56ea50 Is this thing no through constructible? 0a791cd0-2236-44db-b1fb-c7667d0565a9 And is the Sentinel Nothrow constructible and 94b0e27d-9867-46ff-adc0-9ed3af7296c9 we don't do anything other than copy strides? c7b31ae7-2368-4ec2-9312-2708531ed769 OK, so that is correctly strengthened. 63692804-0594-43fd-aa4a-fe9fb639f5da It requires constant, so that's this here. ccdcc113-88bb-48b9-aa19-2bd66e9735d6 And convertible to here I'm looking for 417e1102-c712-48fe-afeb-b1cf3bdc280e anything reversed because convertible 197a7810-fc84-458e-a195-1f25ce23de01 and constructible take opposite orders. 9aadee6f-c75f-4921-b6f2-8f1ce0a4fe65 It's very easy to flip them. 38e1152e-e097-4fff-bab5-b4d34bb3283d So here are convertible to iterator, 38bcc6b2-2f6f-4131-9e6a-3ed3a4a1e279 T view base iterator and convertible c78c6ef5-bbe4-404c-a294-b7c630f581f0 2 Sentinel TV based Sentinel. 1dd258d4-9616-4f52-af59-be1f0311e573 Yep, that's good. b7c3f476-849d-4509-b3aa-cbc15c3b03f1 So the constraint is correct. b379ec39-5240-4956-9750-c01805973eb2 This we're going to move the current e35ae230-a87d-4e91-889a-2f80fd219dc5 or move other current, move other end, 39659011-83be-4381-a821-c61d840beeb8 copy the stride, copy the missing. 473333fd-d1c7-4ebb-937c-07b13422bc55 Yep, that's all good. cb00a3c4-af56-4c66-8183-521bda2b1f20 I don't even really need to ccf094e9-2ac2-472b-84f7-c6b7d5ca4113 look at the definition below, 5b29fe3a-738d-4b9e-adf1-93a26f99f5b9 although I I will Scroll down 8d6faa08-f51b-41b4-afb2-f00ef9782013 and take a look at it. 81343a1e-f4e2-4a17-b0a9-3ba23323f900 OK, so now we've got observers. 16125583-fb2b-417f-a7ac-46be3447b3b0 This is a pure observer, 5e5128c8-4b5f-4475-a31f-5626ee2e1957 so it doesn't need to be no discard 4d78be7c-aa12-4854-9d63-eddc14391a7f according to our conventions. 77c9d7f4-cc54-4380-93a4-f15122b444ff Context

concept, c39e6633-d032-4477-a2f0-6bde6a770c04 spur cons based iterator ref base 62314107-7761-4be1-a825-1c138d5cdcaf constel ref no accept return current. a8c77d28-c512-4e34-a987-7217db6d848c OK, so these are good. 1123d755-416e-41f7-bb2f-756b2d6281be Then we've got drafing. e9f6665c-2d3d-45e9-9b56-e6106d47d65e So if you deraf, yeah, 69979189-5d69-4db8-a825-705e9e534781 you really should be inspecting that. d6086b1b-9825-4050-886f-301dcf15c844 That's pure observer, 06ee1f30-30d2-4bd7-a4ab-c3d6e0d2135c so it's no discard context, product type, 92dd14a6-52e6-412d-a5c1-3d1b128c461f auto

734133e9-033b-465c-b17f-f3469dd9ab1e We do have the content there. 823205dd-cd91-4d75-822d-d4bad168df74 Yep OK, d9a213de-1fd1-42a6-87b3-47f9248845cd we do have a let me scroll to the left. 66c99e3f-955f-4693-9da4-6213f2a8e937 If iterator debug level is not zero, a9ebddbd-e1ff-4fc0-8adb-ad8e128529a0 we verify. 9cd483a4-da72-48a3-a0aa-15c6c4505038 That current does not end because 6752fa29-7113-4eb1-b750-4b950cbc16e9 you try to be dereferencing. 2677d650-3984-4886-9720-b1a2e48d6da5 Here I'm looking for like copy paste errors. 5d2471ec-8f8d-48b4-8866-72a912782d9b Can I dereference stride, 1293bb69-d428-4c1a-9d78-3e886634fe7f view and iterator that's right. 6038bc0f-2eb5-4154-80ae-c50bd980a114 Same comment return DRF current. 897f67d9-b106-4144-80c2-da4f73b4f69d Yep, that's what we're supposed to do. c321d7f9-a854-42c9-b2f7-acaa1ecfa6d4 OK, b9e1ab21-8388-4fae-91f1-54eb917fe63b so here when we pre and post increment 1c6b145a-81e1-4da6-a333-42daca8fd1a2 those uh or the pre increment 78e4bf42-fd67-49f9-a0fe-accfcbe3b687 that is ignorable so we don't 931b537a-67ff-4931-966b-3bd9967b4f79 want no discard context iterator. 9cf70158-f234-4bf0-8d42-6707ac2892f7 If opt plus plus. b691a918-bf42-4acc-b75c-231b1fc218d3 Again, IDL, f4c092d4-b36b-47b4-9165-567119b8ca3d check the currents not end, 206f840a-e456-4784-8d0f-13bec3940954 cannot increment stride view and 31e26e7e-2549-49f7-87af-77922ee417f7 data rate or correct O missing. 4ffc568a-231c-43d6-ba99-deb3ecf3bc88 We do not say range is double colon. b624e80f-63f0-4c75-8345-5055aa1c0ff1 This should be capital ranges just like this. 04ecb5ab-f133-46bc-831f-f2eff139749f This is just purely a style thing. 43b6cf6e-ffcc-490c-8a44-3485aa3ebf20 This is not actually vulnerable 1caf8eeb-0d6b-4c0e-8b52-d38fa105a8f3 to any sort of hijacking. a174b873-70f8-4e5c-a8fb-6c84cc26b521 But in the future, 01438b05-f519-4496-b94b-2c62912a3be9 it could allow us to like replace c7951c2b-1f20-435c-8c3a-c56e79e74092 stuff with like inline namespaces. 10407083-23f9-4cf1-8131-18d723a4f349 I don't think I need to comment why, 8b3d2000-3aff-455b-bf05-e92ba97597fe UM, here, uh, this is just clearly a, 518da25f-5d30-48ac-8ab8-ba07f99add10 I think O because range is advanced, 782415fc-b7a5-44d9-a7d0-d1df5572ccbf is probably used down here. 43b0a7f6-64bf-4ab4-84c2-628084a2f1b0 OK, so missing is here actually do want 9571293f-dbdc-4d5f-b592-d9f8295eeb55 to check the definition, although I'm 9184bd7a-5ab5-4cce-8940-c4fef36c6aff confident this is going to be correct. fe940f62-f4f9-4fca-9a6e-fdb0934360d2 A plus plus equivalent to missing is. 26c0a6f4-3022-409f-9249-8a66c341f5a7 I see why it was. 66965efd-166d-4b1e-98ff-07cdfb17e8da It was a copy paste and then replaced 9cf099ea-4b12-4e2e-aebd-544a49460d18 from the standardized. Very tempting. 589c0c81-b426-47ed-bdeb-9272da61fc72 Of course missing is ranges, 790025db-a148-4ba8-a148-b1da8b4e2d00 advanced current stride End 1454bcd1-e2dc-43a6-8277-497821ebde4a returned to you for this. 41f9e992-c9c8-47d8-a09f-dbe0bdbb0c04 OK, so we do have the return. 67e8df3e-a00d-47e9-bffb-848d2835c473 That's all good. b7a60391-8809-45a3-8e87-6a562ab963ab We got the precondition, c8a404d8-3ab3-47b3-920c-1edd1c3276e7 I'll just cross that out. f7d661f9-e519-411e-a233-ce14c6c34c9d For now we've got the plus. b5b84c64-18f3-4e80-9b62-640ee6f2e561 Plus then we got a post increment. ec1618b2-8efd-49a6-85a5-5cc162596896 Sex for void plus plus int plus plus 24146a21-25c9-4ea9-819c-c9a66a6519be Dr for this nothing else to do. c6180619-b00a-43d4-9eb7-1c7b57a40f13 But here and again we could 67cb276e-a7fa-4bd7-ac20-fefe76343aed discard this quite easily. ec535382-62e5-403d-8b03-de4c6bbcdad8 Counts per iterator plus plus int if we 5804ac3c-dcaf-4085-b0ce-36d296cb927e have forward range base then we need 1d241e7f-e1a4-45f2-9cc5-fe2081a008a0 to do the usual dance auto temporaries. d8ac9035-3c09-4f2e-aaea-d8527f118395 This increment return the temporary. 82afdb29-7325-414d-b0f1-42ea677b5f90 Yep, that's all good. 9e832cf2-80dc-4b7e-8f81-d551c605d858 Decrementing constexpr iterator 98515126-aac3-41e5-876c-b241dca2404d ref decrement requires byte irange. 44ccd34f-3498-48e4-b293-061600891cdb Base range of advanced current ed7d89a3-ad06-4e39-9bef-edd03e61d19e missing minus stride. 6502d2e1-4cbc-4dbf-a184-52dfcebd29b0 Let's check what this is doing. 0e114eea-ba74-4217-93e8-549e4c6aa60f Let's see, we've got this one and this one. ee9ad77e-3d35-4079-9458-ade61c654149 OK, so should be ugly. c82cd92d-f5c5-405f-a942-709f3539a71e Ranges advanced, correct current, 51aa2a16-3da3-431c-8a3e-945a364bc3d6 missing minus stride set missing to 0dbd0fcb-7450-494c-bfd5-8b0a3152514d be 0 return this OK, that's good. 772118d3-cc3a-45ab-8e91-2932986669bd And then let's go back U here let's c90ebda1-9f6a-45e8-9647-8e47eebd43b0 this one OK constexpr iterator by value. 4191382c-cae7-4ab4-9a3f-9f4bfd2a2bbf Redeck int or sorry post Dec INT c293a2dc-6aa2-4ee7-bb0f-02ab9c637633 requires bidirectional range base e7719ec7-a86b-44e3-8cbe-1083af342c57 auto temp is DRF this three deck. 6f97d6b9-2ecd-4ade-b040-90ea3e7dd0e9 DRF this return temp.

This is all fine. f0a5f099-3740-4ceb-82be-3d3fa0e36f19 If the offset is greater, zero, f4d29627-8f30-44d1-b6d9-e768e349ae76 OK here I do want to check the 69f26112-84f4-45c5-a102-0618a9c3bb71 definition because this is doing work. 870817e4-cd06-48c1-96ea-334fc66bd626 Yeah, we did this one. 9de3bc21-062f-4755-8cec-0b62889ed1f0 OK, so preconditions. 261d8c19-577c-4ac7-bfd4-21ef4042225f That's what this is checking. b3742e13-b74b-45a1-9394-2f3b6d50fffb If north is positive ranges distance, ff3799a3-2c0b-4883-b4ef-3066e2c6d213 current north is true. d1e88c3e-0044-451e-ac99-8929bf6dcc4b That is negative. 30b01d04-dd99-4701-b25f-334df4c5b04f The effects paragraph applies recondition. 9b6510a1-0d84-4f41-b4ec-96fda0007b03 OK so. 0342a2de-e7df-4e94-b21a-1649bf76e7f2 This is first we're going to check 293e3b0f-8077-44fa-96c2-5118c4bc9773 can we even do this multiplication? 98414c89-182d-4aec-9b76-1596a8eff155 So this is very good. cf3b1fd5-fdc8-4e7e-b51c-284b303e1925 We don't wanna do an integer overflow e07205e3-8ad0-4352-8a4d-11ebab36c2a7 while checking for the precondition. 22bcd075-a508-4207-b154-61d768ecbbb4 OK, so. This also seems really familiar. 843de0e4-a15b-4996-898f-9275f528fdf4 I think we solved this problem elsewhere. f1e1c4d5-1135-4322-af23-04432d553ad3 Although I can't remember where. 171dc487-5ba6-441a-9a66-aac5af346646 And we've got a two-part test here. 8d0cb209-df99-4d68-9612-bcadd39f0ef4 OK, so.

bf73c6af-757a-47e7-a9b8-63e226e4ca9c And what is constrained? 4cc99a79-a531-4e69-9c54-8579c5d53293 I think they're actually equivalent dda70c94-fead-44b9-ae69-4828300c2d2e according to how concepts works, 5a14274b-1399-43b3-8634-5e5b9049e209 but I'm not 100% sure and. d968569f-9e44-439f-9437-8092447800a2 Even if they do happen to be equivalent, 041c6e77-d2ea-43df-a146-daecc8f8959e it's worth following the principle 46278b12-4411-43c1-8633-b7664b632de9 that if we have our implementation b9b5f12a-5b0a-4c7e-90a8-dcfaf8664c3c match the standard as much as possible, cf453b11-1a9f-453f-803b-2ae909cc96b8 then any remaining deviations 520339e6-af9b-4131-a879-f8afebc6067c from the standard will be things 60b5f8fa-4c57-48a4-b807-e9121c3a551f that are necessary for either 77ef63a8-504c-4286-8cbe-0371db5ea846 performance or conformance, 6bcc6cfc-8720-42f2-bead-f2d0d789caff or some weird implementation specific thing, 19b7aced-4dc4-4f9b-91cd-1aa60423f543 so it'll draw attention to those cases. 21c46ca8-405d-4741-a994-6d38b115d067 So that's why we're going to comment 57cd0878-60b2-4ac6-bda1-0b5fa20c1f1b on this class definition here, 2b586330-1427-491c-a4f4-f6c6d529d7cf that reversing what are we templated 0a4aa473-82a8-482f-b35a-c66a5e054901 on and then what's an additional 88282c3d-28e6-4951-868a-ee15c5b906df constraint seems to be unnecessary, b662ef82-43ca-42a2-8bc4-839763b115ef and we shouldn't do that. c9e16e58-e694-43a6-b6d1-969317bdbb80 Even if we're not exactly sure 6894e122-52fc-4310-91c6-5479776856c3 whether it's observable or not, OK? e56c6476-3f2b-4f8b-8b9b-673836dcd21e Let's see some discussion between a8a5b2ef-9997-4326-b458-d198c3f13e94 Nicole and Casey about when do c6fa600c-97c5-463f-a9f0-ad336ff47a2a we define iterator category? 668b2d99-e219-4df1-80a1-fa770e730975 We only define iterator. d4c34bb0-f9d5-44ec-adb2-1a6fbf475b7b Sorry, 56f2fabd-6248-43c0-976c-462ed6bf4f21 say that this basically comes 10d0d584-7be8-4482-a035-ca3085a89696 down to what is the type not 286a1c0b-d48a-4ee1-998d-05edd89bb6fd defined iterator category when b6ab35d1-3b1a-469f-bd5e-e21d547dc58f the underlying range is input. ef369eb8-35b0-4f48-9ed0-b9ae038d3259 That's specifically says we 0820ec54-66ff-4a94-b842-038e4cf99a6f define iterator category, 663227e6-3ac3-4e06-9819-83b58172db6c but only when the underlying 9af94277-3bd7-4715-b42e-feb4c5ccdf32 range is at least forward and. 14314177-fdda-4c4a-be87-700718baea23 I I brought forth the point that 94c125f1-7215-4285-8347-abe3c3d7e6e2 single pass iterators might be move 26cb337d-9af7-4cda-8b18-289d796632b3 only in in the range of design, 7bd07b2c-4835-42db-8ce1-e42bcad1c428 in which case they might not have d0406f5b-e526-40f0-bd85-7f0ce99ed26c a corresponding iterator category. 5c7ad8a2-e07b-4c10-9c52-cd55f7168e46 But that doesn't explain why we don't 286a293a-2896-4c6b-96df-1528d06c9dea define one when they are copyable, 4e204b2e-0509-4795-95d3-0e0631f05cca and they could actually model the C++. 8692b09a-2eba-4f0f-9125-6e50b70dd416 The legacy Iterator concepts we yeah, c73194ff-c2ac-493c-a172-9220c0bec0f6 because yeah, if you have if you have 87cadfa3-315a-4c72-8ff1-c7845dde29b3 a classic input iterator and then you 0b1be7d1-bdde-4d0e-b263-627cb9ada8fd just start skipping every third element, b1614966-b0ad-47c8-88a1-740104ae87da you're still an input iterator, 726bf07e-40d3-4807-ad4c-8cfd33967e36 so that seems like an interesting. f1413634-6f43-493a-ab51-1e1bfdbfcfaa It's essentially a design question, 8a4df4d9-c5a3-4f01-935e-68007a7407ae or at this point it would be LBG question. 926324d7-6c62-4b40-ae40-94c50706fe0c So the PR is definitely implementing 839b8ccd-5d39-4b6f-96ee-0cc2ffac29b1 what the standard says, 2479fe15-c446-4cc2-b8fa-b636a7a65edd but it's a good question. 50b608f5-cc0a-4c14-9ab0-bdf2ec51dc04 Like why does the standard say that? ade192a8-f5fb-4c54-9ff7-3cbac1a04879 I'm not actually sure. 3001f4f9-2d30-427c-8caa-ae3ef2fd6734 Let's see, ff5ca7f3-ac0c-4818-846c-8be702c22182 is this true for like other views as well, a9a079a5-4b74-43c9-b73f-233477d62097 like I don't know transform view, bc9164a5-5684-4b96-924b-23021edc83c4 I feel like should be probably an c0fc3aeb-7825-4aa9-a4ea-55926e59aaa3 input iterator most of the time. c7570c64-994a-491b-bc1c-3d30e07522aa Yeah, I can't remember seeing this elsewhere. 3196fedd-29ae-4cf7-b5be-e5086eab5c59 It it came from Iterator base so 49fe1a03-ae3e-43a4-afe2-641fc6f831e8 we could search for any currencies 7970ae00-34ce-4422-8043-1e8a62ac0688 of thing because this is one one ead81e39-3f62-4295-a8b0-e8bed6655674 thing that's nice about following 5f9096bb-b713-43ec-a5e4-26c0a1b30a48 the same naming conventions all the d3c0742d-675e-47f1-bb42-e89798a2b8ec time is that we can just search. d9fb955b-7c92-4210-8e33-81f7fbd9079a And if we've done our job of. e83d8ec6-7cd4-4977-8865-b7bbcf3cfd1c Following precedent, f6985e6f-f1ac-4c74-9f6c-0c4877ff7fa4 well then we can look for other currencies. fc33dbde-76bf-45f2-bd2c-71edd945600e We have very few things called. 3e00cd51-38d5-4773-a63c-ef209d997fa9 We do call iterator based, 1ec1de28-f9ef-47ab-8102-4d11a9f6a137 no do we call base iterator? 53f7e8b8-3e56-4b89-9278-18810bd24973 What was it? 092a8545-165b-48ad-9c6e-17d1ac9654b0 Iterate array, oh oh, that's a global thing. aaaec180-beb4-488f-a165-cd28190973f1 Ohh, I think I do want to comment separately 3c5da8ef-c0c6-4c34-8650-9beabc013e43 that we should not shadow this iterator. 2c7ada8b-6394-4178-899d-102a6cfe01c8 Base is a global STL name for within stood cb15623d-54e0-4745-93d6-f556ecc5f4dd for either iterator B0 or Interbase 12. 80b303f9-7f54-47a1-a1bf-ca76deb04882 We should not shadow this even within 8b4f2b1c-639b-4aba-a78e-e51ac28e4216 a class. It's way too confusing. 4d9ab48e-14a8-4867-9124-55aed30111d0 Yeah, O maybe elsewhere we've ed0e1144-0909-4bcd-ba4d-f8fbb4fe6201 called if we've had it basically 167348bc-92fc-4219-acad-4538f7127c29 by the name of the property like. df91eabe-4c8a-4b77-81d1-ab75e20be338 Category base or iterator concept f9be8912-c1a5-47c5-b625-656866b2b191 base or something like that. 84bb3770-fa13-40fa-919a-6b654b1dca49 Yeah, here's a type def called Base iterator. 89c7314f-189b-480e-a085-12be86a631ab Can you think of any ranges that ef2063b0-9588-4b97-9e1b-4c6349ff5b01 have had that sort of helper thing? 16fefa4f-8d8a-478b-8268-8456d31bf2b2 We would have called it like, 19d574db-a045-4b52-924e-e5e7cc644e14 yeah, category based. 6d86d624-fd5f-4648-87ee-499fb1f3f149 I guess you said no off the top of my head, 3a7d9446-c900-4d14-b558-bbdc7473621f but I know there are something I could do. 421e02b8-1480-49a0-b876-8f359adf0463 Ohi oh here we go Interbase. 85c167de-8126-4bff-9fa5-454fd53a1824 This is the precedent. f5118857-714e-472c-ac68-376f10fc8b88 Interbase is pretty neutral. f4d10725-55e9-4a65-90ba-625c90be0561 OK I will recommend this because ea84a42a-9973-4758-831e-c3f8b47344f9 otherwise it's way too confusing. 4fd3617c-bdbd-4f9d-9f7d-6abcf146366d Let me actually put this bfb3339a-f60e-4e97-87b8-74213993b976 outer inner base in Lacey. 6136b0e0-b042-4da5-af4f-d28ab903491e Split View was probably 77240f28-621d-4edb-b859-8bf613d96e05 one of the first ones. OK. 670db941-4c15-4883-a861-a9345958fa55 So I'm going to want, uh, 724cebab-c3c2-4646-9c26-9b51fc1050d8 where it was extra utility, you think? dccc8f00-812f-4a0a-b9bb-3e3a418e7404 I know this after a zillion 75234d8a-082c-4d78-ac1c-df228659c182 years working on the STL, 6bd7ae76-2fd4-4636-a91a-8973155bd387 but I forget where things are defined. f221e9b8-02a8-45ad-9752-053898f8a673 What is defined iterator base? f0b8c920-f781-48e9-b6e5-bd0edc1917af I wanted to say X utility add sex memory. 3f90035a-1a16-4b33-8da4-0342481a7fba I've tried to get. bf568294-92b1-4fc0-b924-00281662b3b3 I'm guessing it picky about like cf3c474b-26d1-4253-922f-ac908099d8d1 shadowy and tasks like if somebody 56b0a3f0-b4bd-4faa-9683-becd7a7ae6e6 defines a test variable named count. 7f33d6db-ecc7-4f07-b2df-c1483cbd113f I've basically stopped complaining that hey, c001a196-c9a6-412e-bcf7-ba603f1a1e7d this could chat with the name of you e0cfc297-590d-486a-a4fd-f4f4acc7cd9d know the student count algorithm, f9202350-a998-44b9-822a-136fd72743b1 but for classes in the STL, d8fbdb5c-064f-4e5f-9cdb-2c35ee87d7af I feel very strongly that 83dee108-a389-46f2-87d4-aff84495061d we should not shadow them, b6a78c74-17da-4516-9e5b-467bfb7a0807 even if there's no compiler warnings. 682d30ee-7b87-429a-ba4e-98e7b4a755a4 Just way too confusing if c1074de0-6dd9-4610-8cd0-b28471cd6249 we do a global search. 6b5f250c-0064-4990-9a7b-495c37654844 OK, so hit Y to get Perma links. 80fe1ff0-6730-41e8-b806-f397cf2f6354 I'll copy the whole thing just 4d0c2c5a-66ce-4115-b75c-690f12f642c3 so you can see the context here. 2e613dcd-7b3f-41d2-aef6-1b41b502ea9c OK, I wanna comment here. 2434d91c-0424-44d3-9537-f455cd0a73af There we go. This shadows. 4442d55d-e0cb-4482-ae07-97db81d679b7 This name. Shadows on important base 72307fb9-f3ed-4807-b645-f721a8683090 class used throughout. The STL. e48e4271-ecb1-43c8-ab3b-aa332ece9c54 It's brilliant base class type def. 25365a6a-1dde-439a-9299-c20931e3da70 Umm? To avoid this shadowing, 1da42627-d081-4e91-a401-097a0a7703da which greatly complicates searches even. 498bc8a5-083a-472d-83b5-71e11f50f38d In the absence of compiler warnings, 109bb949-f40e-44aa-8a5f-068cd8b16909 I'm trying to provide rationale so 165bb11a-f5eb-4553-8f81-9ea93add79b2 the contributor understands like 3120249d-ff41-4eeb-b572-16307031f832 why we're so nitpicky about this. d4adbcc1-94a6-4a52-880c-04da866c503a I said let's look at ranges and look 7017c460-2388-4816-815f-3ca7db93fa24 for an occurrence of inter base. 23098156-6ae0-4c13-ab3b-68a83ec405a9 We should not use the term inter base. 5a0d0716-582a-4084-b90a-c24b733639d8 We should use category, base category base. a9bfc06d-e9ed-4b5a-bf8c-4dbe6791df1f Oh because it's providing the 21b87c78-a6e6-4cce-b32e-9833976e4d71 iterator category. Good point. 6b776bdc-35d5-4c32-939f-5cb7a6507ab7 Yeah we have 123. f79fb445-ee8b-4b60-abef-7b80bcb17dbb 4-5 distinct category bases in the, 1accb250-7b3f-4a6a-9f48-dcceaa27fa52 uh, uh, ranges header. f5c2ab08-cd4b-4d1d-bf08-7aadc990cace 2e2d4919-e857-4ebe-898e-31dc9edee4bc This seems to be the 107518fd-274d-464b-9fe3-b185eca6db33 standard name for this thing. 8ca1c40a-8a1c-4bc9-92ee-c0a21d540b24 That's definitely become the most common. 0ca45d91-2cea-4b47-a59b-ee970db0f803 Yeah, and the the more a92cf581-20c8-40b9-adce-df636d2c4aa9 we follow this pattern, 1cf41414-11a0-4872-a660-f93056e6a18d the easier it is to understand. 7f566012-7eba-4fc5-9dc5-b163ad5642e8 So thank you. OK, uh, let's see. 2e02429e-fe2f-4ac1-be63-b335e21197fd We should use the name category 03e4b73c-45f1-4f98-9837-665d9c847d09 based as the space class exists e0ad68b4-55bb-4f14-80e1-a44eb4d7f193 to conditionally provide. 5790fdf5-a675-41df-8393-c9920ff4edde Iterator category. ed2f2167-7be4-4105-8f7e-26706ba0562b OK, let's see if that looks right. 61567907-9cb5-4d9e-800f-e3a56acef2e8 This name iterator based shadow is ff54d158-1c0a-4f85-8c1f-460cdfd9c852 an important base class type def 95ba566b-b96a-4aba-aff6-b63618ce1d83 used throughout the STL iterator 0891f0a9-b59e-4795-bbb4-13324c430863 base to avoid the shadowing, 15aab7bf-acf9-4545-bc10-3601e3fea64d which greatly complicates searches even 54b35d76-e292-4bbd-954d-423903ee702f in the absence of compiler warnings, 225ee07f-7edd-4e38-9e07-fa16cac1e162 we should use the name category c114a360-7648-42c7-9932-f31016d5d21c base as its base class exists to 03dd5ebc-4fe8-4d8c-b730-255db13aa2d6 conditionally provide iterator category. 5bf1a5f5-e8ca-42c0-ae1a-28fa6a20c4c4 Excellent. OK. 254aefca-3df6-4d05-ac4c-af52160db271 OK. Uh, let's see onwards concern range of 1b22f44d-ba49-4f9d-ae19-d8f27ec1e118 distance current and could be order N which a193f153-be43-4937-8326-d61c2c463909 is a more expensive check than plus equal. df492ce5-1aab-449d-89af-d8cfe3506df1 Uh, where was that happening in 89236fe6-0af4-46c8-abe9-93d6a1215dea the subtraction? Operator plus SQL. 9f44592b-e55d-4853-b262-dcc070522f16 Ohh, we then possible when it was doing that 26edfba7-ce55-4f42-8735-2898138fae2b check to make sure it didn't go past the end. 76b9205c-5f7e-4585-ba2c-81ebb39d0c14 Ohh yeah distance current end but 4890e0bd-7e97-492a-8149-db37dee36e43 distance current end might be ON because 7b883330-41ad-4f98-b441-4d14663a88b3 Endis could us could be a single thing. 7b104812-946c-4b95-b030-14e53bc06b40 It's not necessarily so, yeah. 39fcec40-5a66-40fb-a2af-028ef812d189 We haven't required sized Sentinel. ca52a3e9-c921-4c3b-b064-a87e30089ddc Right now this is only a precondition check, 6df6d0fb-c199-4b60-954f-a005a9ef17e4 but it is true that sneaking in order e2933187-6bbd-4589-9955-90da7a93e52b N validation for potentially huge range 21af810e-e3c9-4754-b138-9cfc702c4a67 in a precondition check is something 4330a078-6a8f-481e-8c68-f4800c19412b we would not generally want to do. 14a377fd-dd83-44f7-a343-3ecbc4e68d13 Avoid that. 998d5ea6-a77b-41d3-817d-ed5f003cd49c Yeah, so are you suggesting restrict c2fd8d7e-d1fb-4f9a-bbc0-423a30d1664d that to say if size Sentinel then if d9a2ae3e-03e8-4494-9b87-a2b839601c35 you check otherwise just hope OK. ec63e888-8865-4a4e-a6f6-f9af7e11433b That seems reasonable, 9776f13f-b003-489b-bc0c-8c6657d04ca8 especially because range is advanced 83195e52-ce8b-41ba-b6a9-a5bf0967173c would still do. Checking right, we would. 8121c3da-f0d1-4edc-abdd-9b4e6816a109 Yeah, or maybe it's a reasonable 65f5954d-c156-454b-8c09-32c28d41ebe2 access range though. caadaf5a-7a75-41e5-bb0b-672ff91bf566 It is yes, but it does so bd74a96f-c194-4d2f-88a8-eda7ed708939 random access does not change. 99d1d148-8001-4299-833b-3eab059ed150 The distance should be order one. 4093459e-f5c0-43c5-abed-e2ffa3723e3f Two iterators as that one ee4b9487-4ad5-4881-b20c-f90c67eb8742 distance between iterator and a a4a92267-fa91-425f-b608-2fe3766efda4 Sentinel may not be computable. b7877620-8b0c-443e-ade7-78837c753a39 In what right? If they don't really, 745d8d51-274f-4f52-ba6e-df7e397248ce unless they model before. 057879f0-de6d-489b-a692-7af63afd5a8e Was that the case where we think like 62b6eb34-a1f3-41c6-b2c6-8e5369ba45ca random access range but the Sentinel is 09292317-d04c-421f-a1b1-38ae6d857028 as soon as you see a null character? 2cea8633-f0db-46c6-9025-6bfa1cc97cab I'm done something like that. 71a6912c-c134-496d-9389-2ad5e50936c9 There's a good one. Yeah, OK, f743b42e-d9e9-4edb-90a3-daf4fada9b7e so find the length you need to see. b185bca9-4626-4418-8499-794b6657c832 Yeah, that's interesting. 1fad2e12-58fa-4302-9d16-f998b16cd7f2 OK, OK, that makes sense. 4a3b0bdd-2575-4bc3-a80c-01151b2e4a9d So we only had the one call here, right? 8757f3d2-afdb-4989-8671-d519721ac915 Right, yeah, this is actually I didn't 0ee98fff-01fb-4fb9-9a61-4fb094a06082 even think of that. That's great. decd6eac-1a2a-4283-a916-7df453c716bd This could also be computed if 76fe4b67-9e47-4438-a866-9b163c334a09 their range was a size range. 874da345-d76e-4378-b250-f9e2c752d174 Right, we could do the size and subtract the 146dd41b-46a8-41a1-9a58-674c7cffe6eb distance from begin to current and no one. e1fe033d-ba3c-4a1f-a64e-187b4d7c4bb3 Yeah, that seems pretty secure 5a92d6bb-9142-4a5a-88b5-ba073d253f94 though to have that be the case, 6d03fc6c-bd12-4a81-9d0b-df626b01493c not the size Sentinel. 1255ae36-9761-4058-92a1-4fd704d69e1f OK, let's provide some attribution. c81a7818-47e5-4b06-90ca-4e93ad957dd6 Casey Carter. 8aa7c01a-f928-4a03-a37f-788000325169 Noticed on important subtlety here, 013a9e3d-60f0-47e7-bace-9230c03d6410 thanks. b302c730-372b-442a-9b14-6374487dedf7 Aye. Although we have a 46bec579-6d8f-47c5-b589-8eabdab2e4d0 random access range here, fcc71653-f912-40cd-97f2-f9b0996c5c56 computing the distance. 22696c12-4a5d-4a5d-ad93-cb6ea8a96d5b From current to the. 1269cad1-2092-4636-9f06-3adebb734f6d Sentinel end might not be an a12568ad-0133-4d65-8c19-f4b63ebaf0da order one operation for example. cc36320a-6ddd-4bc7-9477-cb92b90d5952 We could have iterators into c27f7b5b-7d01-470a-ba39-d0c67fa3e25a a null terminated string. 6d7b7d54-7f9b-43b8-b65d-0106ceb5bc82 Where the iterators are random access, 0ccfa639-c1f4-4e0c-8f50-70150d3c766e but the Sentinel. 1238c339-2e86-4cb4-9ee9-61828023e464 Is used to stop the range when a null. c04a7c41-6ad2-4790-a7c5-356b5353736e Terminator character. 48d07dd0-3fba-4493-9987-bfe12ea60d03 Is encountered. Thus, this is not a. 4f153ff9-0fd2-4dbf-9924-7889a65267b2 Thus this would not be because 3c647c17-3e42-4b98-bf35-ab992374a1de hypothetical a sized range. And the. b245af9c-5709-4d65-986f-e39e32c9cf7c Distance call would be on order N. Sterland 411dbdd8-6e61-459c-beca-0441128a75dd like operation. a11154d0-e67e-4576-bcab-2ebea615f3c5 Because this is just a precondition check. bc9579f0-17e7-48c1-bd3f-7a0355792d96 We should, uh, guard this 616995a1-5249-4a60-bc16-85af1f9d17ab with UM sized Sentinel 4. 9980339a-289a-46cf-a0fb-03ad05dc3603 To preserve the check for the 5a895468-2d74-469e-986d-64d52c5a49a9 vast majority of cases where 2b7c40a5-7385-492c-8ddb-0eb65d844131 the check can indeed be done in. cfacfe13-59d2-4476-b521-b998a32256fc Constant time. 1ea1153d-9106-4129-91cf-8a3969473e53 If it can't, skipping the 6ac96e62-6b8e-4cfb-89d8-8a87ff2a7ba7 check is still conformant. ed946088-d564-4d91-bb86-6291c921bfd8 Should we say that it'll still likely 99d7cb4b-01f9-433c-9edb-56db302dcd0d be caught by range of the advance? b8553092-4e24-4b0f-8b0a-e4efaca82610 So it will be yeah. b0add58d-6833-40c4-b1a8-5030c9f06cd3 There will be and ranges ranges. c9533a54-9e51-443f-94d6-c81ce619a14c Advance won't advance past, 3d7c6d40-55e6-4872-a004-f9bd82ef60ce the ends will still prevent. db4000f4-eac9-4122-a691-ab75c9ff3fd0 The three argument. 220727c0-ffbe-4cb6-8d54-3cb610309496 OK, sounds this look. f7f21ff3-434e-4911-bfdb-5d560b8be31b Umm, Casey knows an important dfa7d291-844d-4745-b5cf-e31935787f3d subtlety here, thanks. e48dfdbb-612a-49c7-997b-1730485fb457 Although we have a random access range here, 11b5f53e-8aa2-4d4f-a885-d25f7ef9a181 computing the distance from current to 51262a0b-6002-4d99-8280-001f95eeb418 the Sentinel end might not be an order. 80a57ff5-2348-426c-927c-942dc9b084be One operation. For example, 13ba36ae-475a-47ff-bcee-bbd7c969bed1 we could have iterators into a 5bfbb576-2d0d-4010-b869-6750f3706de2 null terminated string where 0d8b4c75-7a2a-47fa-9090-d202893fabda the iterators are random access, 0231d658-0c76-4cd2-8019-c360ff2d65e2 but the Sentinel is used to stop b67ead39-18ef-4cd7-9b38-fc160b839a68 the range when a null Terminator d7b612bd-f160-4aae-a767-e7b2f724e9d3 character is encountered. 828a40d8-7f8e-4728-85db-364129b90436 Thus this would not be a sized range, 2675fdaf-2205-4d06-beb6-42d561763153 and the distance call would be an e796ed7a-c55f-4fb0-93e9-f72d681406b0 order N sterlen like operation, 09445783-7a6b-44af-abc8-bcca3da4396d because this is just a precondition check, 629072a8-53e7-402b-bda9-b69e26062b4e we should guard this with size Sentinel 4. 32c845f3-ff90-4eff-92e1-92f17f981179 To preserve the check for the vast ab856ada-affe-40cd-825e-0d81c768e2b9 majority of cases where the check d54d57c5-2098-47c7-9811-cf69c29bfa07 can indeed be done in constant time, 8db971f2-9e0c-488b-8c35-c377a5667dc0 if it can't, 27f6eadc-36c1-4689-b331-e63e6a0420d1 skipping the check is still 2fd8b5f9-40b6-47bc-9152-64f1e1b239c4 conformant and arranges. eaaac761-66bc-4656-88f7-8ab9fb457f3e The advance will still prevent advancement. cf94dbdd-27ee-48d3-903c-e0d46a1c7a8d Ask the end. So do I go ahead? cf703598-4c06-4cc8-b172-75c135bff3cc We just like. bbf2e22f-297b-4151-ae1a-b94d2035ff29 Check the return value of ranges advance. 18950a0d-b297-4fd1-b2af-e9e7b09c72d6 You mean like do the advancement a851574c-e5cc-4dc9-bf73-87e143c272ef and then and then check if we would 3e1ec1b4-cbd1-4429-aa94-04fa5cc1ccc3 have caused like like if missing is 656fdcef-5df8-4606-b519-1d3a9a844e79 a number that's bigger than you? 8ddcb1c9-bd3f-4ce7-9ad6-44beae73fd62 If it doesn't make sense, 365cd4f2-b77f-46ab-aacc-d9dbc2acc89d then we know that the advance d1f76022-ee29-4888-9abe-c9a6d162659a hit the end and then stopped. f231ffe5-8545-49ec-9845-a26b7cb3c74b That seems it seems like we need to do. 5da7e4b9-fd53-49d9-8f01-60e5419f78ad Some some work to figure out 04bb6207-1232-4919-a3e1-7e152eb8d63f like exactly what condition. e75cfd14-40ca-4485-a882-1808850c6085 I think if missing is greater than. 42b30b89-72fc-4b1c-bb28-cf919825bf65 If missing is greater than or f7b2e2bb-13e2-46e0-97cd-8435070faba0 equal to stride. dbc7ec5d-4aea-4dd6-95fd-ff2ed268f106 Then we've gone too far. 2150158e-f75e-4d88-8170-4c28c1f6ac57 Right? af86387c-a9f3-4186-bebf-714dab8a6daf Ohh, because missing the return 96f70706-96eb-4091-956f-de6baf91a40b value is how much we weren't able da7734f2-05e7-4f29-a5b6-620d65914432 to advance right, right, right, OK? a3034ceb-d89c-4dd2-95c1-6766576bd7dd And it should never be greater than or equal. 06ebe9e5-079b-4417-ae39-66ee4d12cc36 Let's try it because. 39ce5172-4a37-4a11-b884-ee5a706916d1 We didn't advance this far as we should have. a4eff343-5a0b-41ef-a8ea-ca467df9a2e5 Strider and his stride times N. 996ab496-eb54-4014-aa33-414904399ca9 Is it just stride? Just straight. c6e58c40-46f1-4427-8e74-2709483e291e If we try to advance the iterator by two 3fcb7167-8c27-453c-a88e-73a5dddcc52c steps. That means we try to advance the c71fff23-663f-4cf7-8379-9942871b7c7d underlying iterator by two times stride. 5aea9f64-894a-4374-9b12-99aee1e96ead OK, two by two strike source two times stride 31887a33-3cfc-4b7f-ada6-5d6f8ee320d2 so the return value is at least stride. a678131e-f52d-4ac6-952f-da974a5b8a39 That means we advanced by one time stride. a2f51ecb-775f-4a4c-a7ab-5d7799940123 But we couldn't advance by the other one, 18c3b21b-76c1-4753-bad1-796406129217 right? We couldn't make the second dd3cfd5c-b249-4acd-9ec9-259ec74ee88a step for the overlying iterator. 0ae8fe1c-a08e-4a27-9313-c14b7ddd2d55 Because the underlying iterator ae660a50-f2a8-4035-99b3-741a68e995e8 didn't have any steps to move. 1868e296-8f0d-488b-ad49-dd6d5fd188fe But what if we're trying to advance 12a7364a-48a7-4b8b-a782-cd5b163ceac6 like 10 strides and we were 54c3cf27-38d9-45d7-9ee3-2424a9840f70 only able to get through like 7? 00a74102-a8a1-4ca7-a648-44285a79bc13 The man returned value would be much c6399677-2808-4d95-878a-cfad71e47b47 greater than stride O3 strides. OK, but OK. 7bd54780-1d23-4bee-a056-1e744c30a3bc So what if we if it's a fractional b0273b67-e499-40a5-9566-913c918eeb5e stride that into fractional stride? fe948c22-6a9b-43dd-9107-691200aac7dc That's that's OK, because there is no 2e59a303-97ef-44e7-b00d-6210f6b0713b actual element that we didn't land on. b4f92da9-3b60-44aa-a6e4-21ee8e5a9b0f Fractional stride means the Mystic past. aa5029a2-1a2e-4d6c-991e-d1496680a494 The end element is, you know, 545dcba8-f445-4dd1-a34b-a5d934f250f3 not a full number of strides 69b4431b-14e1-4e10-9e68-f472a564a8da past the beginning of sorry. bffe62ba-38e5-4af3-9629-8053c5295dc2 A full number of strides from a143828a-ca38-4746-b018-bb6ca1ffeae7 the beginning of their age. 2f72064f-e4f2-4213-bb39-98f70ca9504a And that's OK. 82399c09-6428-4a27-a583-11d59bcb4679 That's a supportive thing. 02df4ef7-98dd-4cbc-a3ed-337398d372a7 That's the whole point of storing d53e3108-4f49-4e8f-be4b-d26b4daa9ff4 missing in the iterators, even. be55adeb-f47d-4e40-afc6-680895e90810 OK, so you know that we ended up 3 three 917379a8-3843-49ef-b3ce-5779473a80bc real places away from the notional place a1b9834c-1822-4886-ab37-26f0d57b482f where the past the end element was. 4e1fa7ad-3ca2-404a-80a6-ec0100d25feb Yeah, so you're saying missing being equal 8579042f-930b-47c9-bd0d-76a8579b37f3 to or greater than stride is the bad case. 9ca9a6f6-7796-4d28-bce7-22442f775a61 Right, sorry, OK. e994c25c-f978-4bc1-ba50-b485f55605e2 I think that's simple enough that 26e7b5d1-5c4c-47f0-8329-fe2dc9375c76 that I had to think about it. 47dde1f7-0d5f-4af7-abde-2dc9adb9ef8c I'm like wow man, 52ccae5e-af67-45c3-8ea1-32899e9f5005 counting by like you know, plus three. 019c74b9-25eb-4922-acc3-645845a45ddf That's hard. eba8fac3-2cc1-4469-9250-e01cb8b87dda That seems reasonable. db7f7204-9d7d-49bc-b150-c1acf34ac7d6 I'm a little bit nervous that it 4c524ed8-dad4-408d-ae08-4b56edbc5aa5 doesn't exactly mirror the standard ease. 0c954d69-a50a-40fa-b252-8e5793aac919 I think I'd minimal. f50244e0-ae95-4dc7-8891-9a8dc55c8532 I want to comment saying why 78cb19b0-c4f3-4763-ae28-f56bdc56d1c3 we're doing this weird thing, 28ea1769-3732-4a57-9444-6803302828b0 but that does seem reasonable. 513d564b-4334-4d54-b4ac-eb5849bbe7fd It also allows us to check 9d26fd3b-629b-4a74-be3e-54f5a130d127 the negative plus equal case, f10a3038-e7df-401f-b739-c488d10bddb5 because right now we don't have a41845b6-b02c-48cd-ad9c-8241e42d5de9 an ideal check for the plus for c2d1c906-c562-4ee9-81a1-78bb267cfa35 for plus equal negative case, 90809bdb-f422-4860-a5cf-4429da934ff3 and so this would be that we actually get. 008172e1-9aa7-4790-a108-a36548b564a5 But like a failure. 1dbe62ff-40d6-4a87-be5c-99c0443044d3 If you try and, uh, decrement off the front. 9163e437-d467-469c-baa8-1a5f3203b8f2 Which is something that Tyler pointed out. d649224e-fe0e-49ee-b001-d8d83a55d449 Is that true because missing? 0f361510-959a-4c11-bfe2-f42d740af41f If are you suggesting just checking 77765656-7d2c-4686-8e6c-1def17582da8 this one or checking, uh, we, a1e48303-1795-4018-ae01-8187a7509751 we should check that we don't even and 8a59eb0b-2ee1-4884-9d35-de02b3ed7084 then we should check the second one is 0. d9287b1f-756e-42e2-9366-beccb0b85a6d Like we should never check that 5f956257-ad75-4b19-a154-851338ebab68 this return zero. OK, right? 05e6255c-22f5-488c-b4ed-9fe42289ad10 If I understand correctly, can you see? 172c95c3-eb63-4edd-a505-8690f4e4c5ae Tell me on. Right or wrong, 01be749a-ffc0-4897-93f9-45964b2c78b0 this something's terribly, 47001dc4-6460-4837-90d3-c0b6807fa69d terribly wrong in the designer. 1ba13096-8f35-4b1c-af74-aed54a456a80 In the situation that we're talking about, b7bbae6d-4e46-4867-8c7d-b7bd91538d3e Rangers advances in ON operation. 5743d45e-993f-4e2b-a987-6f6475018664 Right, right? The fact that it's 95aa575e-a33d-4767-92f7-23c42944f6ae going to advance step by step 838cb3f7-c414-442b-a846-9d38fe3f8fd5 and make sure it doesn't go past aa6042d6-f552-40bb-9a4d-b8175a320439 the end when we can't compute the ff2c285f-16f0-46ea-9e36-cfc3508ac928 distance between current and end. fa604d80-2618-4030-aa66-b10ca1feaa89 Yeah, it's random access that is not allowed. 467a8425-889d-4cf2-82d3-d85645ed886f Prayers are supposed to be constant time. 5d989cd0-4a96-40d0-9ced-e3919f543ca0 Seeing a constraint here this maybe we f5146e38-dc38-40b4-961f-dc8935b77317 need and to be a size Sentinel for. Here. 0668b38e-ec3f-42f2-ba72-ce2268af592f It does seem compelling because 34f4dd26-e370-4eda-b2c9-c91a24ae9a98 the advances are bounded by end or d71c99d7-fc34-4168-a1af-b23566ed4fc6 at least the the forward one is O. c3fed5d8-3062-4c62-8c33-aa0439266fd4 It's really really an LWG issue. 9501767d-06ed-4981-91d2-a17d024a316c It's not even like. 370f4795-0877-454d-aee9-bf7a6543e2a7 And assuming we did a site Sentinel dd0abfc1-cfd5-4f30-9776-a6b59feffc09 forward and this check is totally fine. 9a339635-cb39-45c8-9706-ebb1af52626a Yeah yeah, I'm I think I'm inclined to e9badd7f-cd64-4fb4-9adf-c943f5347fd9 do that saying yeah, we have a problem. d16fe4f3-9f2c-4bf6-a7dd-5fed87ddd25b Yeah, this is wow. OK cool. 66357a6b-0652-448b-bfc8-bcf871ff3da6 OK well I guess I'll delete this. 6fb7b559-b44b-40e1-a82b-c69e659722e2 Should we just file a follow up issue? 70bf23b6-9d2f-47d7-837b-9c061173b360 And not bother the contributor with this, e70bb983-3550-4b8a-abd6-f9cffc9c0733 uh, horrifyingly messed up standards. 4cf6c511-a3bb-4975-859c-0c22ff6f6265 Yeah, yes we should. 0d1e0a9e-8f8a-4a96-98aa-c2a217376423 We should not make this 024a32d7-3b45-4334-931d-594537dfd4f9 the contributors problem. 2511d2a1-277f-4be0-a5fd-8649a88046a3 Definitely don't want to tell 53449f9e-3e80-432f-bbfe-73257ff42872 them to go file to get it fixed. 52ac2186-c4bd-4ed1-ae50-f2f8a8785acf Yeah, let's see can I? 55678897-883f-492f-8526-b1e38e47373e Can I nominate either of you to file that de255349-652e-40bf-a35d-6b28f83771f6 or should I attitude you to do that myself? bd23c6a1-c780-49c0-ba33-6ecff051d71c I'll do that right now. a9b63ccf-c3c4-4c96-ae46-57a8d4efdb1d Awesome thanks Casey. 32165c5e-9353-44eb-bd90-cf2d58c8f3fd OK, we are improving the standard. 96cef5c2-2cb8-48ce-87b7-f8f7302d8537 Thank you both for noticing that c86d43e3-776e-40f2-924f-855da2e12837 I totally glossed over that 3b556053-652d-4220-9649-e79e5de29616 I'm trying to be real careful, 669a6294-28aa-42a8-8c40-d0638c93c829 like reviewing every single operator. c13f1fc7-6045-4701-b611-802927ee6ce6 I'm like. 9a252f9f-3541-417b-bb0a-8ee8ca7529fd Oh yeah, distance runner access plus SQL. 93f27b92-2515-4768-a1b2-bd6f6af641b5 You know it's all good, 0b8e622c-994b-43c6-9c99-447004105603 and iterators and Sentinels are so much 8c7c128f-acf5-4942-b13e-4bdb1da1a6e0 more complicated than the stuff I'm used to. a10f240e-171d-42b5-be7d-dc2199a79b30 So lots to learn. 4b830dfb-3a42-49b0-9382-1a361740b7cc OK, so how far did we get? be47d8b4-7efe-4560-9985-6f3e61a15c81 We were going through I got through 47f877aa-c3a6-4505-a3ba-14f9b8e59263 the iterator so oh that's right, 643743b5-7ba3-4b21-8e1e-ca02fd515dcd we got back to the sized view. 41c3b8fd-57c8-455b-867a-c647eb53730f Overall class, 21e58bc0-ff98-46ce-9e44-73c57476cedf and then we stop for questions. 6ed7e23a-7488-4323-bd2f-e851cced070d Are there any more questions? f011fcc1-07dd-4998-8657-a963588e4e83 Stands OK, 50920da2-7dd4-4d44-85ee-cac5ec0c2eb0 Tyler was asking what happens if the 88602b8a-25b0-47e9-853a-9955b0288ddd minus equal iterator has an offset 922f898b-2c78-42dd-8ba4-782bc0ebd8bf that walks past the front of the range. 91df22d0-c1c1-42b9-aadf-e9e0962972d6 Let's see, 0a15c9c5-1051-4959-bd50-e281a2c6b767 the standard says that it is 2dcf0d38-81fb-40e5-a57a-fc482a7b0d3d essentially implied we. 41773dc2-fedf-4bb4-8ecd-d263dafa87ef I guess we can look at what 73896673-e131-4e95-ad85-e149034d5591 the implementation does, d38af18f-ca79-42a7-9dc0-a59996ae66ff so if you attempt to minus equal 5968acf0-985d-4e5a-b908-dc3a3243b4bd or plus equal by a negative number 332548e9-a79b-4bbe-b382-d41a9861d101 past the beginning of the range, 717b84d4-8e84-481a-a984-890ff83cd2fb then you're giving a hugely de0fdb93-2f96-465f-9cc6-bc8d4b9a83dc negative value to advance. 7382c831-4072-4eb4-8b5b-8e95826d9fb0 You know we have checking that, fe08c328-9810-409b-8099-1422495a9b60 so you actually just trigger e5e343f4-5561-4070-9064-2c44bf9334bd undefined behavior because we don't f9a6e6fb-6b1f-4610-81e9-da6ddc0859f9 store the total beginning anywhere, 5c538070-962c-482b-9b96-4e718297f96b so I think it's UB and it's not something 1d52edf9-1c67-4400-a51f-12fa87130e84 that we can easily check either. 3e51282a-adad-453e-8279-e50b6b21eb98 For example, if you have a range, 2fde0a78-f65c-4ac7-b157-34086b1b8007 say everything is like totally normal, f670b1ea-8828-437f-a0e8-03c611e74155 it's like pointers and stuff and d4195d60-618a-483c-9584-20750abb4f10 you've got like a million elements, 6e7e3ce5-26ec-4b10-b314-7e3ca95dc47b and you're striding by 10 and 4a997b77-c01c-4ad0-a262-1e35b903ea39 you advance like 5 strides. 7d105e6d-f668-47b1-8026-f71791316f5c You're plus 50, 18aa80fa-9fe0-426a-a995-ee6302fd6cff and then you say OK minus equal 7 strides. b4f9ef7f-a4b0-4697-b430-002e608f77fb We don't store the original. 6365ea6a-c6bd-4479-85cf-e8c560323922 Bounds of the range anywhere. aa26019e-7a66-4bf6-9bb8-66816da7220a We only have current in the end, d1dc60ba-0506-4a37-a869-1e542647b9b0 so we have to trust the user that eaec6be9-04b7-4bbc-a2fd-d9826aaa1555 if we jump back seven strides, 9b749563-40f3-4e5e-8590-99333b3c1cda we're not going to jump off the beginning. c7deb576-8fba-4905-b520-75eed0182f18 So it's just you B. 04b06b7c-8e11-4ec1-92b7-1bbe66bfeed7 It's not something we can check, 120314bd-3713-4e79-b837-5e80e4dfdbb5 even in principle. 9aab3211-1bd4-4ea4-91cc-4bbb1db00866 So we we can check the plus case db9eeacb-ebda-48c4-ad12-f0c5415bf00e because we do have the end, 7cf8b7c9-3beb-4ce8-9548-c02585bda7c5 but we can't check the minus case. 57d4d584-184c-4ad6-ae9d-ef631a1253f1 Interesting asymmetry there basically. 275a7f98-5194-48f9-a145-f32cb6176b87 OK, and that's all the b2d4fe18-82a4-422b-997b-dca5f054b554 issues that are pending. d5fb3a42-ad7a-478d-bfa9-99d78982b831 OK, so let's take a look.

Umm? 3063c7c4-2668-4f09-8527-fdaca88624f3 This is not testing a cross comparison. 8db5200a-f983-425a-b009-ee34aceb743e These are all consed. 0c233f4b-5e5c-451e-a7b4-2f6d1d5d0839 This looks like a copy paste fa152775-9e11-4dbf-aef3-446374bdac97 like it's intended for. a7017589-4ad8-41ec-a7dc-be7f2f7c7c87 I to be used here. Let's see, 770b9f66-9280-42fa-9b6a-2fd880c34c9c these comparisons were CI CI 2. 3b83a700-8423-49e1-9289-b094165c9f52 Here were just replacing CI with I. 636402e0-e2b5-41e2-86b2-1e598e2a6973 I'm almost certain this is a bug or 0a4dfa08-d352-4735-8998-f0afb9b7e717 essentially missed test coverage in fact. 70bf10c4-979c-4e6a-a9fa-60afcdcc1b3f Yeah, they're there. ea0f70bc-d52e-4c60-95e2-6797d4fb2dcb The lines are repeated. cb3efbc5-6594-41ea-8496-073f29b24f4d They're in a different order, c604e956-2a52-49c8-8c4f-f8dbcf2e71db but they're repeated. 04b63b3e-f0e6-4c1a-a09f-1552d750b1cd I think this is a deficiency. 48e48577-eb45-4376-86a3-34e4b232ec71 Include the cross comparisons. 56f2a969-4365-44cb-9b9a-8538880b8f2d It appears that the spaceship. 5f732ebd-6713-40fb-bb95-1d8f61f7c3d6 Casts here aren't testing b271f1de-549a-4093-8cad-f037c9d73a98 cross comparisons between c55e5c7b-df16-473d-97c9-7c6c85f1e711 constant and non constant. e59dc268-66d3-4d15-8e56-60d5f8fc659d Was it intended to use I instead of? 97cb60c4-b6b5-463e-8725-d8d191b630ed CI here. 88e466da-de61-4b74-bcf1-790ec37ebce4 Yes, found a potential copy paste 679aa6bf-e807-4b5d-8bd0-fb3b2c62806f issue with one missing character. bbd1aba3-9f8d-4643-b53c-2912a8e7fb99 I am fully awake OK before 8f487055-c8d7-497b-a3a5-5d8ce1a58139 my caffeine runs out. 8ddbed83-b684-434c-8ff5-098fb29f33a7 We've got a couple more minutes. 88fabbf6-38b4-495f-b86a-aa3396b7f7b7 I think we can finish this test if ee371736-d39a-4eea-a238-713f542ff999 constexpr symbol for symbol T constant 18ad371a-03b3-47b4-af3d-5903acc7e8f9 iterator T constant V constancy. c2c4c794-4cf6-4c65-a5a2-e0859d63fd98 The range call ranges size, 57e94210-c682-47be-b0b4-da91e737a804 which we did not have a using for ad9020ef-1101-4438-828c-a85de6d66614 same age range difference tea. dc162783-a442-4e0c-9102-15082f4c658b Yeah, if you subtract it so size b864e7b9-5ae2-4d13-9d40-6866eb5e769d 4 you can do the subtraction. 5d30d436-3115-4f4f-ae51-4806031f6a52 OK validate constant ref for the base. 2b07b673-4cf0-49d7-bebb-86bfe5a76212 Yep, that looks fine. 0384912c-856c-4ec0-b8de-2788b90fc457 That looks fine too. 7f702884-2f26-47f9-ad48-7f86cedb6f70 But some ints 687c2036-3d60-4e34-b292-7f43fe541ba8 01234567891011.

OK, so I think we 30eeea76-22f2-49c4-acec-9d5ad9b258cc don't have a huge preexisting issue. 58410a73-0eb4-4f48-b15c-9338336aada6 OK, I will request changes. 435fe008-b5e5-4bd5-a7b0-0f775b0895e7 Any other comments? 32f602fa-821f-4570-a221-abc1c7b98fdb Some comments about? 4da43c26-35bf-4f8e-92bb-acdf2af7a52d Should we just define no fa140df5-1ef0-4d38-8718-06e89c672785 min Max in our test code? d42694f6-90ae-4c84-9f14-f100fbe49913 I believe that as annoying 6e1379c0-b483-408b-91da-f2a92fa96b53 as the status quo is, 831aa6cf-44a8-407b-b940-deb78292757e what we're doing is reasonable and the 9ceebae0-acf5-4148-96ed-510beff5e5a5 reason why is if we define the no min, 1a344bd8-87ae-4f50-ba48-4053fc575b9c Max macro and our test code d1dacd31-99b4-427d-b5e1-5345362983a8 for our convenience to not have c48876a1-8faa-4796-9537-531e3f10cfa5 to parenthesize min and Max 42553e03-7054-4851-a8b5-25d73ae276ad in the presence of Windows H, 69f5929e-e66f-4f08-ac64-a3c7a977ea17 we could accidentally miss cases 95b4ae6e-21cc-404e-afa6-a3150e904e36 in product code where we really 2351e955-c941-4138-be80-5c4815346c89 do need to parenthesize min Max. 4b276910-ddc1-4f3a-bac1-84fcc5738cb5 Having the test code to be exposed 8af401af-84b0-4b40-a613-88d3fe4cade0 to the same macros as user code 92b0e4e3-6e30-43f2-b731-f128128a7ce7 means that we will be forced to be 67240786-8921-4d73-9603-f6cfddfa1cbc disciplined in the product code, 0baa7e50-1b7f-4c41-bff7-45c692fa6a45 so as annoying as it is, f5be9187-a0a7-4326-93c0-310cd7ce2b06 I think the absence of. c2822cb7-3b86-49f1-9653-e37eb6d0326e And Max is reasonable. 184cec11-2993-4dde-9255-84112c711071 We did originally use known min Max 4c888e9f-01ee-4467-9547-e67debea0c6d in some of the tools like validate 45e03f48-590c-4c09-80da-f37867a3f6cb used to or parallelize used to dbeda816-56ad-48c0-a376-2154f1477ebe include Windows H and then define 2142ac0b-1d29-4e76-b5ba-4c1015750809 nominal Max because it's just a tool, 1e738dd9-81db-4db5-a077-9c85a2fd5a26 it's not product code, 055ded66-377d-41f4-9fc9-98db7895bf73 but for the actual product 5411d61b-33de-46cc-a2a7-96504bd47587 code and test code. ae88e269-5de1-46d2-98f7-734a3c749211 I think that what we're doing is reasonable. 61d46ac4-9669-47e7-9835-3f9cd20bbfdd OK request changes. a3804681-160d-405c-889a-b157adf417ad Do I need to add any comments? c1f4c990-8a8a-478f-9e2f-1b6569e58550 I think I will. 97882440-966e-4c6c-81a0-ef8c41f5d9d2 I'll just say thanks, accf3e7b-45e9-48af-96ca-cbcb173062bd this looks great. 541f5600-0615-400e-87b2-bce241a18bb3 Found a small number of issues. 306ba264-9560-4602-8a97-ca91866530c9 Should be quite good dress. 9f8c818b-e140-42fb-aef8-0062017971f1 Yeah, nothing that I found really required f29e0239-9aac-4509-9b41-15fb5e486522 like extensive refactor or anything. b1735ab6-bf50-4b2f-ad40-c9c8f6a96722 The biggest issue we found 1f525c4a-a0b7-4125-a4ba-04cdac467b36 was in the standard itself, c357d867-8f59-42c7-b674-7209c9b1c93a with the difference whatever. 6f6708b6-1618-4559-8fde-bb4f01cfa03b OK, I found a small number issue. 3e00cac3-5e8f-400c-84a5-78cee7dec0f0 Should be quick to address. d1bdbb28-2075-4274-92b1-e01a82e14b39 I think they also should get a smile cat. fdd03666-9ddc-4eca-852c-079f3f41c93c OK, quest changes. fcc720f7-3206-4d9b-b6d2-5367a5b93b03 Yeah, so double checking all a46113f4-ec1c-440f-8e42-337a808fa04a my comments made it there. 289eb8fa-9b0e-4052-9fa3-a02b74fac773 The race condition with the other 1c25bc3d-e6f6-4ca2-850b-bcb3ad10d8b1 PR that I've got the typo and ac2c7ae3-c5ba-46e7-b9a4-3ea3a5b134cb the feature to macro tests triple a4e4b7f8-0081-42f7-b584-3d91406b3f1d mirror that Nicole's offered to do. 7fae13d3-01f6-4b5b-97b0-e8d47aca1067 Thank you reversing these parameters. 1d880ef8-8f66-43fc-b900-7097f867cb02 Using the ranges macro, e84571af-6e54-4adf-b5ad-e159960b7ea7 don't shadow iterator base. 9a86e1a8-82bd-4591-9f96-e0043a34ff18 What's going on with the cross comparisons? c9705a4a-b8b5-49da-a3eb-348786f4414b Yeah, all of those are isolated. bdc53d48-01f9-4e7e-b1c1-0e7246ecf118 They should be pretty easy to fix. d3ac2727-639e-4458-aadf-b201929bc0e5 OK, cool.
