# Corrections to Matheus Izvekov synthesized knowledge capture

The interviewee provided this feedback which was applied verbatim to the knowledge capture output

Minor:
* Typo: court -> core
* I think the quotes could be cleaned up a little bit, they don't need to mention filler words.
* Typo: bays -> bases
* I misnamed the Numerics Study Group (SG6) as the "mathematics study group".
Executive summary: I never said I believed "high vote counts do not indicate understanding" reveals a systemic problem. That's based on my personal experience on a very small sample size, so I wouldn't be bold about claiming a systemic issue in WG21, but I do believe it can be a problem.
P4:
* I don't think this is a flaw in the committee per se, it was a flaw of my expectations as a first time comer. I don't think it's reasonable to expect that we have a committee full of experts about everything, specially because of the complexity and baggage of C++.
* About the quote "consensus indicates political alignment, not technical consensus", I didn't mention politics here at all, I don't think that's what happened in my story. This missed the point I was making, that people some times do vote on things they don't fully understand, following the lead of someone who they trust is an expert. I can't be thankful enough that I gained this trust. While in the ideal world we would expect everyone to be an expert in everything and provide very efficient feedback, that's not realistic to expect, and having this trust is better than the alternatives.
P11: This is a historical flaw, rather than a current one. The committee is a lot more proactive about requesting implementation experience. This point came up in a discussion about past mistakes.
P10: There is some nuance here. Perhaps it is counter productive to require that (volunteer) paper authors document every objection raised about every paper. The published papers will most likely address concerns that had mensurable impact on consensus, for example when it gets a "come back again after addressing these concerns" vote, but if it's merely something someone asked and received a satisfactory answer, and the paper went ahead anyway, then this most likely will only be found in transcripts.
The papers are publicly available, but the transcripts aren't. It's a separate discussion about whether we want to make the committee decisions completely transparent to ISO outsiders.
E2: Calling this a disaster is a bit of a stretch IMHO, maybe a blunder would be a better phrasing. Its worth mentioning that is in no way James Touton's fault, this was backed by the committee at the time.
E5: I didn't make any observation about whether the linear algebra proposal was sufficiently backed by evidence of need, that was a point made by Vinnie. I wouldn't be the best person to have an opinion on that as I wasn't following that paper through the process (or any library-only paper for that matter).
