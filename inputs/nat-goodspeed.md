## Transcript Start

[00:00:00] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I grew 

[00:00:12] **NAT GOODSPEED:** up in Fairfield, Connecticut. My father was a lawyer and my mother was a homemaker. And, um, we had, um, a couple of acres to play around in and [00:00:30] a, I have an older brother and a younger brother, and we did a lot of, um, just fooling around playing things. My older brother at a tender age, um, had read about the curvature of an airplane wing and how the airflow over the top of it.

[00:00:55] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Versus the airplane under the bottom of it is what gives the airplane [00:01:00] lift. And he decided that he knew how to make an airplane. And so we had some lumber left over in our yard from a building project that my father had finished. And he took a wide board about nine feet long, and on top of it, he laid a narrower board so as to get the stepped air flow.

[00:01:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Nailed that in place. Another board was the body of the [00:01:30] plane and, um, across board for part of the tail and a vertical one, which was hard to get right. So he added a couple of straightened out coat hanger wires to hold the tail vertical. And that was our airplane. Um, it was going to be a glider because there was no provision for an engine.

[00:01:51] **NAT GOODSPEED:** We didn't try to make a propeller. Mm-hmm. But, um, then it was the question who was going to be the test pilot. And because I [00:02:00] have a younger brother and because I was considerably smaller, he was unanimously voted test pilot by the rest of us. Um, and so, uh, four of us, myself, my older brother, his friend, and my friend all trooped up to the top of the little hill by our house.

[00:02:24] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, so five of us, myself, my [00:02:30] older brother, his friend, and my friend and my little brother all trooped up to the top of the little hill by our house carrying this airplane by the ends of its wings and its tail. We set it down on the ground for my little brother to climb a board. We lifted it up. And at a signal from my older brother, we ran down the hill and he said, now, and we let go of the plane expecting [00:03:00] it to soar into the air with my little brother.

[00:03:02] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And of course it went who to everyone's surprise, not least, my little brother and my mother told us later that she was watching the whole thing from the kitchen door convulsed in laughter. It's very entertaining to make things whether or not they work.

[00:03:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** My older brother [00:03:30] took clarinet lessons in grade school and later on because we had the clarinet and there there's a cost associated with acquiring such a thing. Um. I also took a summer of clarinet lessons, but um, never pursued it beyond a few weeks. But, um, my mother, um, ensured that each of us, uh, spent [00:04:00] a couple of years singing in a choir at church.

[00:04:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And I didn't realize until way later how much of a positive impact that was. Um, but when I was 12, I went to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and there was a [00:04:30] small room in the math building where there was a teletype, um, which on which you could dial up the computer at Dartmouth College in Hanover.

[00:04:43] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so, um, I wandered in there one day and a guy was sitting at the teletype and I asked him what he was doing and he said, he's programming the computer. And I said, what does that mean? And [00:05:00] he said, you tell it what to do and it does it. And so he typed a little basic program, 10, what is your name? Or 10 print, what is your name?

[00:05:09] **NAT GOODSPEED:** 20 input and dollar 30 print. Hello? And dollar 40. And then he typed run and it said, what is your name? And I typed Nat and it said, hello, Nat. 

[00:05:25] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Oh. 

[00:05:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I mean, at that moment it was like, [00:05:30] whoa. There was nothing like that had happened before in my life. It was suddenly. An obsession. And, um, at one point during that fall, um, there was a, a surprise holiday and, um, everybody was to board buses and go off to the beach for the day.[00:06:00] 

[00:06:00] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And at that time in my life, I was perennially late to everything and managed to miss the buses going to the beach, which made me sad until I realized that I could spend the whole day at that computer room.

[00:06:21] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, so it was not a bad day after all. 

[00:06:27] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What do you, and then what, what do you play, [00:06:30] um, musically? What's your background there? 

[00:06:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I started playing acoustic guitar and. I had friends of mine and I played in high school. It's a little overstatement to say that we had a high school band because we made no public appearances.

[00:06:54] **NAT GOODSPEED:** We, um, recorded many, many hours of [00:07:00] reel to reel tape, but, um, the results were something less than what you would call music. Um, but there came a point when, um, a new priest came to town here and put out a call for people who played guitar or other instruments because he wanted to put together a contemporary music ministry.

[00:07:28] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And my [00:07:30] wife, um, said, Nat, go join. And, um. Not really knowing what I was getting into. I went and I met some very, very good people, um, and thoroughly enjoyed playing music with them. Eight years later, um, the family who had, uh, got that music [00:08:00] ministry organized and running, who came from Guilford, which was an hour each way, um, announced that they could no longer make that trip, um, twice a week, once for practice and once for Mass.

[00:08:22] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so the, the wife of the leader [00:08:30] of the music ministry was our bassist. And so the guy who took over as leader of the music ministry said, well, has anybody here ever touched a bass before? And I had, um, so I started playing electric bass. And bass has the virtue that if you know what the chord sequence is, you can get away with playing the root note of whatever [00:09:00] the chord is that works.

[00:09:02] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It's boring, but it's not wrong. And so I could start from that, as shall we say, the baseline. And I could get more interesting as my skill developed. And I've never claimed to be a great musician. I just have a love for it. There's something satisfying about. [00:09:30] The sequences that you find in music, the patterns that you find in music.

[00:09:36] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And I think that, um, there's an orderliness to good code that sort of rhymes with the orderliness of the music that, well, I, for one, enjoy. I think that if you were more into stochastic music, maybe you wouldn't be that into [00:10:00] writing code. Along about 1989, I had just finished a medium size, um, classic C program and there were a couple of salient things about the classic C program that directly bear on what became my interest in C++, which I didn't, I, which hadn't yet read about.

[00:10:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, one is that. It used [00:10:30] classic C polymorphism. I had a number of structs, which all were supposed to be referenceable by the same kind of pointer. And so, um, there was a struct that had to be embedded in each other struct at the beginning so that a point or two, any of them would point to the first prefix.

[00:10:54] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And that prefix had to contain a type variable. And so any [00:11:00] code that wanted to figure out what to do with any one of those objects had to first switch on the type variable and do whatever action was appropriate for that kind of sub object. Um, the second salient point is that, um, there were lots of these objects floating around in my program and they were reference counted.

[00:11:25] **NAT GOODSPEED:** So the, the base class object had [00:11:30] a reference count, and I had to use a macro to increment the reference count every time I wanted to store a pointer to one of these objects, and I had to use a different macro to decrement the reference count every time I wanted to forget a pointer. And that works if you are correctly using those macros [00:12:00] in every case.

[00:12:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It bothered me even at the time that if I forgot to use one of those macros, that the compiler was perfectly happy. It had no idea that anything would be wrong. The effect of forgetting to increment the reference count would be that I would delete the object too soon and I'd be left with dangling pointers.[00:12:30] 

[00:12:30] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The effect of forgetting to decrement the reference count would be that eventually I would forget all the pointers to it, but I'd be left with, um, orphan objects cluttering up memory, and eventually I'd run outta memory and the c compiler was just no help. Shortly after completing that project, I started reading about C++, and first [00:13:00] the obvious, um, attraction was the relationship between base classes and subclasses, and the idea that polymorphism is part of the DNA of C++, but.

[00:13:20] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, the attraction of the, the power of classes hit me in two distinct phases. First was, oh my gosh, if [00:13:30] I forget to increment or decrement the reference count, the compiler will actually tell me it will produce an error and stop. I can't get away with having this bug in my program. And the second revelation was, I don't even have to do it explicitly.

[00:13:48] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The compiler will do that automatically for me. And that was enough to make me [00:14:00] strongly desire to start coding. And C++. And unfortunately it was another 10 years before I landed in a job where C++ was the project language. Linden Lab, um, is the, um. Creator of the virtual world, second Life, I believe it was the first, and I believe it remains the most [00:14:30] popular of the virtual worlds.

[00:14:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, there was great amusement at Linden when Meta announced Grandly that they were going to introduce virtual worlds, and Linden was like, welcome to the world of virtual worlds. If you need any advice. We've been here for 10 years. 

[00:14:52] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Yeah, I love that. Um, for those who aren't aware though, like, uh, may maybe, uh, somebody who's, [00:15:00] uh, 22 in watching this, right?

[00:15:02] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** And for whatever reason it missed, how big was this? Like where, where did Second Life first appear and how did it grow? And, and help us understand how huge this was at the time. 

[00:15:15] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, second Life was introduced in 2003, or it became publicly available in 2003. And, um, for a few years it [00:15:30] was a curiosity. It grew slowly.

[00:15:35] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and then along about 2006, there was some press coverage and a sudden explosion of interest. Um, people were signing up and getting tremendously excited about what you could do with this world that wasn't a [00:16:00] video game because you could create your own context in the virtual world and. When I was, um, within my first few months, um, I think it was C-S-I-N-Y-C did an episode, a, a two part episode featuring second life.[00:16:30] 

[00:16:30] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, there was a moment when the lead investigator suddenly barked, log off, log off now, and for months after that, um, that was repeated at amongst ourselves to great hilarity. Um, but it boomed. Um, there were, you know, [00:17:00] well over a million, um, active residents at that point in second Life's history and.

[00:17:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, it's still going. It's, shall we say, post boom. Some people never moved out. There are still people who are attracted to it, and there are those who have been there for a long, long time. Um, there was [00:17:30] this hockey stick growth in the 2006, 2007, um, timeframe, and every successive generation of management has a arrived believing that they know how to recreate the hockey stick.

[00:17:48] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And sadly, that hasn't yet happened. There were people who scoffed at it because, um, it [00:18:00] wasn't predicated on the highest end graphics that you could find in some of the contemporary contemporaneous video games. Um, it, in the last couple of years has had a major graphics update, so that's no longer such a complaint, but, um, because you could use it to create anything you [00:18:30] wanted, um, some of what people created was not just weird, but off-putting.

[00:18:38] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so, um, Linden had to introduce the idea of, well, here's some areas that maybe the general public should not be permitted to explore because you have it's members only. Um, for the most part, [00:19:00] you can fly around the whole world and see what people have built, and for the most part. People are very happy to show you what they've built.

[00:19:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, 

[00:19:11] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** yeah. What did people seem to get out of it? What do you think it accomplished? What, what was important about it is, was, 

[00:19:17] **NAT GOODSPEED:** so one of the, one of the things that you gain from having an avatar in a virtual world is a phenomenon that goes back to chat rooms in the [00:19:30] 1970s. It's, you have an anonymous conversation with other people and there's a, there's a party atmosphere to it.

[00:19:41] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, you can say things that maybe you wouldn't say face to face to your friends. Um, you can be someone other than the person whose face you see in the mirror every day. And [00:20:00] there are people who. Um, maybe they're not that happy with the face they see every day. Maybe they want to be, um, a leprechaun. Maybe they want to be a dinosaur, maybe they want to be a gorgeous woman.

[00:20:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, it's kind of funny, there was one of my colleagues, um, was, had an avatar, um, [00:20:30] that was a gorgeous woman. And, um, we would have meetings sometimes and it just was amusing to me that I was dnt in the way that I'm dnt in real life when there's a gorgeous woman in their room. Um, she was, she is far less off putting in person.

[00:20:59] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, [00:21:00] but, um. 

[00:21:02] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** What about you? Were you a resident of, or are you a resident of Second Life and what's your avatar? 

[00:21:08] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, 

[00:21:08] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** what do you do with it? 

[00:21:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I bought an avatar on the second life market that is, somebody had made it somebody not at Linden. I, because I have always had a fascination with cartoons. As a kid I was endlessly watching cartoons and so when I stumbled [00:21:30] upon a, an avatar of Sylvester the Cat, I bought the avatar and I used that.

[00:21:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, then came a great clamp down on private intellectual property. And so thereafter I was careful only to use that avatar in internal only meetings. I did not any longer go out into the world as Sylvester the cat, [00:22:00] because. I could assume, but couldn't prove that the creator of the avatar had obtained proper licensing.

[00:22:12] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Um, and so what does any of this have to do with C++? 

[00:22:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** C++ was the implementation language, um, was and is the implementation language for, um, almost all of the parts of Second Life. [00:22:30] Um, there's the server, which is replicated across very many machines, genes, um, and the server administers an area of virtual land and everything that happens in that area.

[00:22:48] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, the client is called the viewer, and the viewer is just a. A large [00:23:00] C++ program that, um, talks to the server and does the 3D imaging that, um, presents the virtual world to the user. The viewer supports all of the gestures and all of the controls that a user can, can leverage. Um, there are people who use it to make Machinima animated movies, um, [00:23:30] set in Second Life.

[00:23:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, the viewer has a very large number of features added incrementally by different people over the years, and I think there are very few people who could enumerate all of the things that that viewer can do. I think C++ was chosen because of performance reasons. Um, but because they wanted something that was [00:24:00] safer than classic C.

[00:24:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Classic C as I've alluded to, will happily let you shoot yourself in the foot in all kinds of ways. It is possible to code C++ in such a way that you can ensure some of those failures won't happen. Um, it is also possible to [00:24:30] assume too much of the guarantees of C++. There are things that it will not protect you from.

[00:24:36] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and so testing is always, I mean, automated testing as well as manual testing is always recommended. Um, and. They had a very comprehensive automated testing suite. 

[00:24:52] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** And then why, why you, so can you give me, uh, do you get a phone call? Do you get an email? How do you get recruited, uh, to [00:25:00] Lynden Labs in this project?

[00:25:01] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** And, and, uh, yeah. Why, why you at that point? 

[00:25:04] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Well, um, my friend, um, Kent Quirk, um, let me know that, um, Linden was going to O Open Linden was based in San Francisco, um, but had been opening offices during this boom in other cities. And, [00:25:30] um, was planning to open an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And they were having a recruitment party, um, in Boston.

[00:25:42] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And it was an open invitation to developers to come to the recruitment party and see if there was mutual interest, after which there would be, um, a normal application, you know, interview, hiring thing. [00:26:00] And so, um, having been made aware of the recruitment party, I went online and looked at the job requirement, you know, the, the skillset, um, requested for a second life developer and it was a long bullet list and I just went down that bullet list and I was like, yep, yep.

[00:26:24] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Oh yeah, I've done a lot of that. Oh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Been there. Yep, yep, yep. [00:26:30] Wow. This thing fits like a glove. And so it was very interesting and, um, I. I enjoyed talking to people at the recruitment party. Um, they, um, scheduled me for several, for interviews with several people in Boston, and then when that went well, they flew me out to San Francisco [00:27:00] to have interviews with several more people at the San Francisco Home Office, and that went well.

[00:27:07] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so, um, I ended up being hired in August of 2007. 

[00:27:14] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** How did that feel when you learned that? 

[00:27:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It felt great. Um, I was, I was pretty excited about coming on board with this company that was doing something really [00:27:30] new and different and I mean, there. There's no shortage of visionaries, uh, in that, in Linden.

[00:27:42] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I, the guy who was running the brand new Cambridge office, um, enthused to me that they'd been having conversations with MIT about maybe using, um, second Life [00:28:00] as an environment to give burgeoning AI projects a place to experience something like the real world. And it's funny, um, that took a long, long time to come to something like fruition, but, um, eventually that something like that did happen, although not in quite that way, but, [00:28:30] um, it just, there, there.

[00:28:35] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The company very deliberately cultivated a culture that was, um, exciting, dynamic, and they hired people who were exciting to work with. So, um, it's funny, I came on board for my [00:29:00] skills in C++, um, but one of the first things that I got asked to do was to help with a problem that had been, um, acknowledged, but unaddressed since the virtual world first started getting large, which was the problem of garbage assets.

[00:29:28] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And what I mean by that, [00:29:30] when you create an object in second life, there's. Database entries that represent that object. And there's a model stored somewhere. And, um, when you modify that object, you produce a different object derived from the first one because somebody might still have a reference to the original one, the [00:30:00] unmodified one.

[00:30:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** When you give away an object, you're not actually creating a duplicate of all that entry, you're just providing a reference to it. But there was no reference counting involved. Um, at the time. The servers that handled the database entries and the model storage. We're barely keeping up with the demands [00:30:30] on them.

[00:30:30] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And um, the guy in charge of that end of the system told me that if they tried to introduce reference counting, the whole system would fall over. Um, and so there was the problem of garbage collection. How do you discover which of these files and which of these database entries are no longer referenced by anything and can be deleted [00:31:00] because these system was silting up with garbage objects at an alarming rate.

[00:31:07] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, so, um, he had put together some ad hoc distributed processes, but. I don't know if you're familiar with garbage collection. The problem is you start by identifying [00:31:30] top level references to something, but then you have to go through all of those somethings and find all of the things that they reference.

[00:31:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And it's a recursive problem. You have to keep chugging through until you've reached the end of every chain. There are no more references in anything to anything new that you haven't already touched. And it takes a lot of computing [00:32:00] power to go through petabytes of data. And um, we had a lot of machines to throw at the problem, but the problem was coordinating them because if anyone process failed, stopped.

[00:32:19] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It would mean that some of the assets that it was tasked with investigating would go unexplored and therefore might be considered garbage, [00:32:30] even though they were still being referenced. And so you need something that's highly reliable. Um, so I was assigned to work on that problem with the guy in charge.

[00:32:45] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and I spent several months, um, in that domain before moving to work on the second life viewer in C+ [00:33:00] plus, which is what I, so, um, all of the asset garbage collection problem was, uh, we addressed that in Python and so, um. The viewer, the C++ Second Life viewer used Booth Boost Libraries for, can 

[00:33:23] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** you, can you start that sentence again, if you 

[00:33:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** wouldn't mind?

[00:33:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Okay. The C++ Second Life viewer [00:33:30] used a number of Boost libraries because the C++ Standard Library did not yet have, um, a lot of the utilities that would later become part of it. Smart Pointers. Um, you know, one of the first things that I imagined being possible in C++ in 1989, [00:34:00] um, were a Boost library.

[00:34:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Before they were a standard library and, um, that was heavily used. There was a big discussion, uh, during the early, during the first couple of years that I was there about how to communicate asynchronous events [00:34:30] within the viewer program. And there's a library boost signals that is designed for that purpose.

[00:34:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, but there were, there was at least one outspoken champion of doing something more manual, um, where you have a base class with a couple of canonical methods and you have, you introduce [00:35:00] subclasses that override those methods and you provide notifications to those subclasses by calling the virtual method.

[00:35:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, there was finally a, a meeting of all the developers to thrash through this. Um, and I was able to persuade the group that, uh, stand 

[00:35:26] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** by for one moment.[00:35:30] 

[00:35:30] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Cool. I was able to persuade, 

[00:35:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I was able to persuade the group that, um, boost Signals was the better way to go. And we built some infrastructure within the program around that library. But, um, boost function, um, boost Iterator, I couldn't now enumerate all of the Boost libraries that are integrated into the, the Second [00:36:00] Life viewer, but a number of them.

[00:36:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Mm-hmm. The thing about the second life viewer is that it does a lot of chatting with its server, and there are many different, um, actually there are a number of different servers that it talks to and many different, um, communication sockets that it talks on. But the program was designed as a classic [00:36:30] Windows event driven program where, um, an event arrives, you handle that event in some fashion and then return to process the next event.

[00:36:46] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And that works great if all the events are independent of each other. The really interesting problem comes when you have. [00:37:00] A sequence of operations, each of which wants to ask a question of a server, but has to wait until the server comes back with a response. And you can't just sit there and say, well, I'm not doing anything until the response comes because then your mouse freezes.

[00:37:17] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The keyboard won't work. Um, the whole program just stops debt, which you can't have. So, um, if you want a sequence of operations that [00:37:30] are each asynchronous, you have to organize the code in such a way as this chunk of code kicks off an operation and preps things so that the next chunk of code knows what operation you kicked off and knows how to deal with a response.

[00:37:49] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It then kicks off an operation, which will be processed later by yet a third chunk of code and so forth. And, and. [00:38:00] It was frustrating to me that by the time I arrived, it seemed as if a number of engineers at Linden had come to this problem as if it was a problem to be solved for the first time. And so there were at least four or five different ways of addressing this problem of a sequence of asynchronous events.

[00:38:29] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, [00:38:30] um, you know, one classic way of dealing with it is what's called a giant switch statement, where you keep calling into the function, but every time you call, you jump to a different section of code because there's a state variable that indicates how far you've gotten. There's, um, building different functions.

[00:38:58] **NAT GOODSPEED:** That [00:39:00] each reference the next one as the completion to the asynchronous operation. But you end up st screwing your data all over everywhere because every time you leave one of those functions, all of its local variables go away. And there's at least two other ways and maybe three that the viewer was using at the time.

[00:39:29] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And I [00:39:30] was lamenting to one of my colleagues, um, that there just was no good way in C++ to deal with this problem of a sequence of asynchronous operations. And I said what the language really needs is some kind of coine support so that you could. Enter a function and initiate an asynchronous operation, [00:40:00] suspend that function until the result came back.

[00:40:04] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Do other things in the program in the meantime. But when the function re, when the operation completed, return exactly to where you'd left off with the same set of variables and carry on, which is how you're able to deal with synchronous events that are allowed to block the whole thread. But async events, you don't get that luxury.

[00:40:28] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And [00:40:30] my colleague said, well, you know, um, he said, I think in the boost summer of code 2006, somebody submitted a library that has coine support. And I said, oh, really? So, um, there was. A library, um, aspirationally called Boost Co Routine, although it had not as far as I know, been submitted to or [00:41:00] approved by Boost.

[00:41:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, it was written by Giovanni p Doretta, um, and it did provide in Windows and on Mac a way to, um, to build code exactly the way I had been hoping. But at that time, the earliest Mac version we were still [00:41:30] targeting was I think OSX 10.4, and it lacked the library support for the operations used by the boost cover routine library.

[00:41:45] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Another one of my colleagues pointed me to a library called PTH. Which, um, I've always assumed means not quite P threads. [00:42:00] Um, and that was supported on the Mac at that time. And so I was able to adapt the Google Summer of Code Library to use that when targeting the Mac. And so I was able to introduce Coine support into the, um, second life viewer in spring of 2009.

[00:42:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, we [00:42:30] were using that productively. And, um,

[00:42:38] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there was a, the login function in the second Life viewer was an 1800 line giant switch statement. And any coder will tell you that having a single function that [00:43:00] is more than a page or two is just bad design. But in a giant switch statement scenario, it has to be flat. You have to have everything in the same function.

[00:43:14] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, a my manager at the time had extracted a couple hundred lines of that and re-implemented using the Boost State Chart Library, [00:43:30] which represents a state machine as a collection of classes that delegate control between each other. Um, armed with this Coine technology, I. Took an embarrassingly long time to figure out what actually was going on in this flow of control between these different classes, and was able to reverse engineer it as a triply nested loop [00:44:00] with an if statement in the middle.

[00:44:02] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, wrapping an asynchronous operation, which is why all the hoorah. And with the Cottin library in hand, I was able to write that in C++ as a triply nested loop with an if in the middle that waited for the asynchronous operation in the middle. And that was so

[00:44:28] **NAT GOODSPEED:** wonderful an [00:44:30] outcome that, um, that was the basis for, um, a talk I gave, um, that was C++ now 2012. Um. Something like untangling a state machine using Boost Co routine. It was in Aspen, Colorado. Um, I flew from Boston. And um, the two things that really [00:45:00] impress you right away are the gorgeous scenery surrounded by mountains.

[00:45:06] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And the fact that walking anywhere takes a lot more breath than you should have thought, than you thought should have been necessary because you're already at significant altitude and you, you just find that you're short of breath pretty much all the time. The people [00:45:30] who had created the libraries that I'd been using, um, there they were in the flesh.

[00:45:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um. I had been to, um, a couple of GDCs, the game developers conference in, well, first in, um, San Jose, California and then it moved to San Francisco. And [00:46:00] I have heard some very entertaining and very well put together talks with cool slide decks by some fascinating people. And so I felt that I really needed to present something extraordinary.

[00:46:23] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I didn't, you know, if I'm giving a talk to my group in my [00:46:30] company, it'll be slides with bullet points. And maybe I would animate the slide by having the bullet points appear one at a time. Um. It had to be better than that. And, um, so yeah, I did spend time preparing, you know, finding appropriate graphics for each point that I wanted to make and, um, how'd it go?

[00:46:58] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Practicing my [00:47:00] talk. Um, my wife heard that talk, I don't know, six or seven times and, you know, I was iterating and trying to hone it and tighten it and make it better each time. Um, and I had introduced this again, aspirationally named Boost Coine Library in 2009. And then in 2012, [00:47:30] um, Oliver Alka, I think that's how you pronounce it, added boost context to, um.

[00:47:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Boost 1 51 and in February, 2013, he followed up with Boost Coine as part of Boost 1 53. And the trouble with using a Boost Summer Co or [00:48:00] Google Summer of Code Library is that the author has no commitment to update or maintain it. And so in 2012, I was keenly aware that this library hadn't been touched by anybody except for me, um, in the LA in the previous six years.

[00:48:21] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And it, conversely, I was very familiar with boosts, established practice of frequent [00:48:30] updates, fixes, enhancements, and so. When Boost context came along, I was very keen to replace the lower level infrastructure used by the Google Summer of Code Library with Boost context. Um, I thought I was going to replace the whole Google Summer of code library with, [00:49:00] um, boost co routine, the new Boost co routine.

[00:49:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** But, um, boost Co routine was missing a couple of things that I thought that were important to the viewer. And so I wrote to the author, Oliver Kabaka, um, to ask, you know, why weren't these features included and when did he plan to add them? And Oliver replied, explaining that. [00:49:30] He distinguishes between a cot routine, which is in some sense subordinate to the code that invokes it, and a fiber where you can have parallel fibers that are kind of like parallel threads that are peers of each other and that the features that I was looking for were really characteristics of fibers, which is what I was really wanting in the Second Life viewer rather than of cot [00:50:00] routines, but that he was working on an upcoming library called Boost Fiber and, uh, that I could use that when it became available.

[00:50:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so I, um, I did replace, I did integrate boost context into the secondly viewer, but I continued using the Google Summer of Code Library. Upper layer [00:50:30] that resided on top of it. Um,

[00:50:38] **NAT GOODSPEED:** then in the summer of 2013, after many email exchanges, Oliver contacted me saying that he had drafted a proposal to bring the boost context functionality to the C++ standard library. [00:51:00] And the important thing to know about boost context is that it introduces functionality that you cannot write in portable C++.

[00:51:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It uses assembly operations to work its magic. Assembly code is necessarily specific to a particular target machine, a particular bit width. And a particular operating system. And [00:51:30] so Oliver had implementations of boost context for each of the target machines and operating systems to which he personally had access.

[00:51:42] **NAT GOODSPEED:** But that doesn't scale well. Whereas if it became part of the standard, the C++ standard, then any vendor claiming to support C++ would have this feature as part of their standard library. They are already writing a [00:52:00] compiler that targets a specific machine and a specific operating system.

[00:52:05] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so adding support for this feature is not a big, a big new commitment for them. They're already targeting that platform, and so having platform specific support in the standard library. Um, is not that big a deal. So it was an excellent idea to add it to the standard library, [00:52:30] but Oliver told me that since he's not a native English speaker, that he wanted me to proofread and, um, you know, tighten up, polish up the proposal that he had written so that it would read well and not make a bad impression.

[00:52:52] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, when presented to WG 21, our paper was con [00:53:00] considered to be a concurrency feature. And so the first place we landed was in, um, SG one, the Concurrency Study Group. And, um, that was chaired at the time by Hans. Bo Hans Bo, who's most famous for the boem garbage, C++ garbage collector, which I haven't used.

[00:53:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, it [00:53:30] was later taken over by Olivia. Um, and, and we spent the next couple of years, um, iterating through SG one.

[00:53:51] **NAT GOODSPEED:** There were a lot of,

[00:53:58] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there was a lot of [00:54:00] discussion about the idea of introducing fibers and what kind of execution engine should that be considered, what kind of forward progress guarantees should be associated with. Fibers. Um, and unfortunately that was around the time that Microsoft began proposing coa [00:54:30] weight co routines, and Microsoft perceived the fiber proposal as a threat, a competitor, and Microsoft.

[00:54:42] **NAT GOODSPEED:** In addition to spending time and energy in effect, marketing coate co routines, um, posted a number of papers bashing fiber technology. If you were to read those papers, there would be no doubt in your [00:55:00] mind how they felt about fiber technology. What I can say is that there were presentations that emphasized that in very simple cases.

[00:55:14] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, co weight co routines can be optimized a way to very little runtime code if the entirety of the cot routine is visible to the compiler [00:55:30] at the time, at the point in which you invoke it. Um, where they don't do as well is in scenarios such as the use case we had in the second life viewer where you need layers of abstraction that include an asynchronous operation at the bottom.[00:56:00] 

[00:56:00] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And there are two reasons why, um, coa weight co routines are less than wonderful for that kind of use case. One is that, um. If you, every caller of a coa, weight Coine must itself be a coa, weight coru routine. Every one of their [00:56:30] callers must be a coate coine up to the top most level where you launch and manage such things.

[00:56:37] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so the markup is viral. Um, it pervades your code base. The other that, um, was apparently mentioned only in our papers, was that every invocation [00:57:00] of a coate coine requires a new allocation. And every return, every final return from a Coate coine requires a free and. There was,

[00:57:19] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there are suggestions that you could maybe reduce the memory [00:57:30] thrashing by having a pool of coine activation frames. And our answer to that was, yes, the term for a pool of activation frames is a stack, and what you get with fibers is a whole separate stack that doesn't need allocating and locating on every call.

[00:57:56] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And anyway. [00:58:00] Um, 

[00:58:00] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** what would be the downside to standardizing this?

[00:58:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** There was. An attempt by WG 21, sorry, WG 21. 

[00:58:15] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Start that again please. There was an attempt by, 

[00:58:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there was a call by WG 21 to get us to sit down with Microsoft and unify the proposals so that they wouldn't be two different things. [00:58:30] And we duly met with Microsoft on a couple of occasions. Wow. Um, this would've been probably in Lenexa.

[00:58:45] **NAT GOODSPEED:** What state was that? Um, it was shortly after bringing this proposal. Um, it was in the context of a WG [00:59:00] 21 meeting. It was not us going to Microsoft in any other setting. Um.

[00:59:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Uh, the result was a paper explaining the unobvious fact that despite a similarity of use cases, these technologies are incompatible at a very fundamental level. [00:59:30] Um, one could be fiber, technology can be characterized as suspend by call, where coal weight technology can be characterized as suspend by return.

[00:59:45] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Very different things happen under the hood for a suspension of any such thing. And so, [01:00:00] um, I think there was some resistance in the committee to having two different ways of. Accomplishing what seems to be very much a similar thing, but they really do have different strengths and you use them. You would select one or the other, um, [01:00:30] very strongly depending on your specific use case.

[01:00:34] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And when you're trying to build something that resembles, um, parallelism within a thread, what you want is a fiber and not a chain of coate co routines.

[01:00:55] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Who was representing Microsoft to WG 21? 

[01:00:59] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Uh, Microsoft [01:01:00] sent a number of people. Gore OV was, I think, the leader of the delegation, or at least. He was the one most visibly championing Wai. He gave the Wai presentations, um, you know, headed the discussions of that feature and so forth. Good. 

[01:01:25] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** I, during our pre-interview, I could have sworn you, there was a quote from you along the lines of [01:01:30] there was no downside to standard standardizing.

[01:01:33] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** You can still add other models. So when I asked you what's the downside, I was actually expecting you might come back with that, but is that, am I wrong, you said, or have a sentiment to that effect back?

[01:01:48] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It seems to me that standardizing, um, the fiber proposal is all positive. It imposes [01:02:00] what I believe to be a slight extra overhead on implementers. But it's empowering in a way that, um, you can do things with the language that are simply impossible otherwise. There was frustration. Um, Oliver made it to, uh, a few meetings.

[01:02:24] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, mostly I kept in touch [01:02:30] by email and

[01:02:36] **NAT GOODSPEED:** at various times we each have sort of despaired of making progress. But, um, what I was starting to say is that somewhat to my distress, I became the face of the fiber proposal. Um. [01:03:00] Despite the fact that it was Oliver's idea to add it, it was Oliver's implementation, it was Oliver's original proposal, it was Oliver's API design.

[01:03:13] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I have helped to evolve all of that, but, um, and Oliver's name remains on every revision of the proposal. [01:03:30] Um, but I think that if this documentary, um, does one bit of good, it might be to get Oliver's name attached to the fiber technology. Mm-hmm. Um, he deserves way more credit than I think people in WG 21.

[01:03:58] **NAT GOODSPEED:** You usually realize [01:04:00] reading tone of voice into email is notoriously hard. And, um, reading tone of voice into an email crafted by a native German speaker in writing in English, um, maybe harder than usual. Um, and so I know that Oliver was frustrated as I was, um, exactly the extent of the [01:04:30] emotion or the nature of the emotion.

[01:04:31] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It was harder to intuit. Um, and there came a point when Oliver sort of,

[01:04:44] **NAT GOODSPEED:** um, threw up his hands and was like, um, you know, if you want to pursue this, go ahead. But I can't, I can't have, uh. Uh, I can't emotionally depend on this anymore. [01:05:00] Um, but, you know, I've kept him in the loop with everything that's been going on, and he, as we began making substantive progress, he became interested again and has been, you know, participating in email discussions.

[01:05:22] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, 

[01:05:23] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** because ultimately, how did this, this story started around 

[01:05:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** 2013, 

[01:05:28] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** so, uh, [01:05:30] what, yeah, what, what ultimately came out of this? Like where did this land? 

[01:05:38] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Well, it's still up in the air, and this is, this is a frustration. Um, there are. Uh, two major tracks for a proposal to go through WG 21. [01:06:00] Um, one is to be a library specific proposal, which is what we originally thought that the fiber proposal was because Boost Context is a standalone library.

[01:06:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Hm. You reach the library Evolution working group, LEWG, which is responsible for helping you refine the design or reject in entirely. If you get LEWG design approval, then they forward the [01:06:30] proposal to LWG, the library working group who take your design and turn it into standard ease. Standard ease is very different from, not only from English, but from library documentation because.

[01:06:47] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The standard is not trying to describe to an end user how to use a particular language feature. It is directions to the implementer of the language in the library to say [01:07:00] this particular construct must have, this semantic may not have that side effect. Um, this combination of things must produce an error, and this other circumstance is the dreaded undefined behavior.

[01:07:21] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, so it's all couched in instructions to the implementer as to what should happen when you see an invocation [01:07:30] of a particular library feature or language feature. Moreover, as with legal documents, it has its own specialized terminology. That must be applied consistently over the whole breadth of the language standard, which runs to a couple thousand pages.

[01:07:51] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so every new proposal must be expressed using that terminology and using it consistently with the rest of the standard. [01:08:00] Even when the terminology changes, while the proposal is in flight, you have to revise your proposal to match the current round of terminology. Um, that's one track going through LEWG to the library working group, which can then, um, if it approves forward the proposal to be voted on in WG 21 plenary, where it either gets shot down or it becomes part of the draft standard.[01:08:30] 

[01:08:31] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The other track is to, um, have a proposal that affects the. Core language writing, the core language wording. And for that you go through the evolution working group, EWG, which helps you with the design. And if it approves, they forward the proposal to CWG, the core working group, [01:09:00] which prepares the standard ease that is going to go into the core wording of the standard.

[01:09:08] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And again, if they approve your proposal with its wording, then they recommended it into the plenary where it gets the final thumbs up, thumbs down to become part of the draft from which it could later be pulled if other papers are submitted to do that. Um, but that's the [01:09:30] process. To our dismay. Um, the committee concluded that our proposal touches both the library and the core wording and that, um, it therefore needs to go through both tracks before being admitted to plenary.

[01:09:50] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, so the, um, the pinball bumpers were SG one for a long time, and then [01:10:00] L-E-W-G-E-W-G and then get to LWG and CWG. And we got, as far as the core working group, and the core working group said there's a design change that we need you to make to require a particular behavior instead of making it optional.

[01:10:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** But it is a design change and so we need to [01:10:30] send you back to EWG to approve that design change. EWG um, voted to approve the design change, but did not vote to send the proposal back to CWG for final approval because they asked for implementation experience. And so not being implementers of the C++ [01:11:00] language, we had to do some scurrying and we were able to produce an implementation example using one of the implementations of the standard library.

[01:11:12] **NAT GOODSPEED:** There is one implementation of the C++ standard library that exposes an entry point that happily, um, allowed us to do exactly what we needed to do. I wasn't aware of that, but [01:11:30] discussions with other, um, interested parties pointed me in the direction of that entry point. And once I knew about it, I was able with that implementation of the standard Library to, um, write code that would, uh, have the required behavior.

[01:11:49] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** A Watergate Deep Throat type comes to you and says, here's how you do this. Is that kind of it? 

[01:11:54] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Actually, he wasn't even one of the implementers of that library. [01:12:00] Um, he simply knew about this, um, entry point because he, um, was an enthusiastic user of fiber technology himself and had had experiments, you know, along these lines.

[01:12:16] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, 

[01:12:16] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** so you overcome that obstacle. What, what's next? What do they throw at you now? 

[01:12:20] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Well, um, I brought that to EWG and said, look, implementation experience, and Microsoft said, we don't think that is [01:12:30] implementable using Microsoft's visual C++ compiler and runtime. We will have to consult with our backend people in Redmond to, um, get you an answer about that.

[01:12:44] **NAT GOODSPEED:** That was in the fall 2024 meeting. Um, it would seem plausible that they might have been able to produce an answer to that question within the next few weeks, let's say, [01:13:00] but in fact, um, the answer came back late in the week of the winter 2025 meeting. So EWG could get the answer that yes, it was implementable.

[01:13:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** EWG could say, okay, we remove the barrier, we will forward this proposal back to LWG and CWG, neither [01:13:30] of which had time to review the proposal before the end of the meeting. And neither committee had time to approve the proposal in the spring meeting, which was the last opportunity to get into C++ 26.

[01:13:50] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and so at this point, it is the earliest we could become, part of the standard would be C++ [01:14:00] 29 because of the three year cycle, which would be 16 years after introducing the proposal originally. Um, I've been heard to remark that WG 21 makes the Catholic Church look impulsive. Um,

[01:14:22] **NAT GOODSPEED:** we have hopes for making C++ 29 because[01:14:30] 

[01:14:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** the core working group CWG has already approved the wording with the only snag was requiring this design change and getting approval from EWG for that design change. The approval has come, CWG needs to sign off on it. I need a few minutes of committee time to get that sign off. Um, [01:15:00] LWG has already reviewed and approved the library wording.

[01:15:04] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, LWG asked me at the time why. Uh, a particular member function was marked, uh, was not marked const when according to design principles, it arguably could have and should be marked const. And I took that question to Oliver who said, [01:15:30] okay, there, there used to be a reason why it was marked, why it was not marked const, but um, at this point it can be marked const.

[01:15:40] **NAT GOODSPEED:** There is no implementation reason why it cannot be marked const anymore. And so I made that tweak to the LWG wording to mark that constant as they asked that it should be. But that needs a few minutes of [01:16:00] committee time to, to get approval. The problem is that, um, the. Kona meeting and the upcoming winter meeting in London are largely supposed to deal with national body comments from the National Body Review of the draft C++ 26.

[01:16:24] **NAT GOODSPEED:** That's their priority. Um, we, our proposal should only [01:16:30] need a few minutes of committee time from each of LWG and CWG, but LWG and CWG are commissioned to deal with national body comments at both of the next meetings. My position is that of trying to sneak in during a, a small time slot when nobody is available to deal with the next national body [01:17:00] comment.

[01:17:00] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, but there is quorum that can address this question. And I don't know that we will have any time during either of the next two meetings. Um, it may be that we get to the summer 2026 meeting before, um, our proposal can get the committee time to be forwarded to plenary. [01:17:30] Jeff Garland has told me that, um, the Boost Steering Committee has been apprised of this 12 year odyssey and, um, they,

[01:17:47] **NAT GOODSPEED:** they think that it, uh, points up some problems with the committee process. And I think [01:18:00] that, um, it's. Not only likely, but has happened that authors who bring a proposal and have to wait this long, give up and go away and seek other ways of getting their idea, their library, their language [01:18:30] feature, um, published.

[01:18:34] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, in this case, as I said, it seems to me there are excellent reasons for putting fiber technology into the standard because you can't write it in portable C++. This feature allows you to do things that the language runtime simply was not designed to do originally. So opening [01:19:00] the door to those features is.

[01:19:04] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Very empowering and very target specific.

[01:19:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** So, um, I've, we've pushed on with trying to introduce this into the standard and with luck in a tailwind, it may make it into C++ 29. Getting any library into the standard, [01:19:30] um, takes a champion and it takes, that is, it takes someone specifically determined to bring that library into the standard and it takes a fair amount of persistence.

[01:19:43] **NAT GOODSPEED:** It usually doesn't take 12 years, um, or 16 depending on your point of view. But, um, it does take persistence. There are hoops to be jumped through and

[01:19:58] **NAT GOODSPEED:** as I've alluded, [01:20:00] um. Preparing a library to become part of the standard library set requires specialized knowledge of how to express the library in standard ease. Um, it's, it's a learning curve. It's very different than simply preparing a library for people to use. [01:20:30] I have to come back to the idea of a determined champion.

[01:20:36] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I think that what gets put into the standard is what is chosen by specifically determined people to try to get into the standard. And I believe that, um, proposals targeting the standard go through a [01:21:00] process of. Um, review, um, critique improvement? I think that, um, it is typically true that a proposal that arrives at WG 21 that gets introduced into the standard is a stronger design, more robust, safer to use than the form in which it originally [01:21:30] arrived.

[01:21:31] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, but

[01:21:36] **NAT GOODSPEED:** it isn't WG 21 reaching out to pluck the best available libraries from the universe of C++ libraries. It is interested parties coming forward with a library that they think should be part of the standard for whatever reason, they think it should be part of the [01:22:00] standard. And persisting until it gets in.

[01:22:04] **NAT GOODSPEED:** My observation is that, um, it isn't the influence of the chair that, um, the group, um, makes the collective decision. The, the obstacle to perfection there is that [01:22:30] there are some 20 plus study groups. There are six sort of main track groups. Um, not all of those groups meet all week at every meeting, but an interested party may find that they have to scurry around between different rooms to attend discussions of [01:23:00] proposals that.

[01:23:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Concern them. They may have a conflict. They may be unable to track a discussion going on in one room while a discussion they consider more valuable is happening in another room. Um, moreover, um, not every proposal manages to snag the attention of every participant who is physically present in a room. Um, some people [01:23:30] are just not knowledgeable about the subject matter and don't particularly care whether that proposal makes it into the standard or not.

[01:23:41] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And so they are physically present, but in effect not virtually present, not meaningfully present. Um, so it may be that a smaller number of people than you suspect. Then you expect are [01:24:00] making a decision as to whether a given feature should be passed along the, um, the path to standardization. And

[01:24:14] **NAT GOODSPEED:** moreover, as I've indicated, there's,

[01:24:22] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there's a certain amount of, um, salesmanship that has gone into some proposals, [01:24:30] um, slide presentations that emphasize certain specific use cases, um, while ignoring, um, arguments against, um, and I think people are susceptible to that, people who are not deeply knowledgeable about a problem domain. I. I might say, oh yeah, well, all of that [01:25:00] sounds great.

[01:25:00] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, because

[01:25:06] **NAT GOODSPEED:** the breadth of proposals brought before WG 21 is quite startling, and you're asked to consider proposals ranging from, um, [01:25:30] deeply involved matrix algebra to, uh, the proper use of, um, sim d hardware on varying machines to the interactions between different threads. Um. And some of us are. [01:26:00] Okay. I, I see that that's what you're talking about.

[01:26:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** But I don't know enough about the subject area to, to make a meaningful contribution here. I'll just learn, you know, I'll just listen in and, and do the best I can to pick up what's going on. I, you know, I talked to a few people. I wouldn't say I've talked to everybody at any given WJ 21 meeting. There are over 200 people at a typical meeting.

[01:26:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, but I[01:26:30] 

[01:26:31] **NAT GOODSPEED:** really haven't gotten the sense that anyone there has been saying, okay, I'm speaking on behalf of this particular Boost Library that I'd like to see, um, advanced into the standard. Um, I think that that could happen if someone were to pick up that, um. With that banner and run with it. Um, [01:27:00] I am not eager to, um, take up advocacy of any additional Boost libraries because this one has been pretty consuming.

[01:27:15] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and so for instance, if we're talking about Boost fiber, which would be a very plausible follow on to standardizing the functional equivalent of Boost context, [01:27:30] um, boost Fiber exists if it could be, if it could use the international standard for its underpinnings instead of boost context, which as I've said, has limited implementations.

[01:27:50] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Boost fiber is written in portable C++. And does it need to be in the standard? Well, [01:28:00] um, maybe not. I think there's really strong reason, as I've said a couple of times, to put boost context functionality into the standard. I don't know how compelling it is to put boost fiber into the standard. Um, similar remarks about boost code routine.

[01:28:22] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The,

[01:28:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I think, [01:28:30] um, for many of us, perhaps most of us who code in C++ the availability of a high quality open source library that is publicly accessible in source form suffices, um. What things need to be part of the standard library? Well, you [01:29:00] know, if I keep saying this, but I think boost context should be, um,

[01:29:10] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there are know Krono, really good example of a library that, um, is now part of the standard library and arguably should be. Um, I, not every program [01:29:30] needs to know date and time or perform computations on daytime or duration, but that's, that's a really basic domain. Hmm. Um,

[01:29:46] **NAT GOODSPEED:** bind function, um.

[01:29:53] **NAT GOODSPEED:** These are things that are so useful in [01:30:00] code that I've written and maintained code that I've maintained that was originally written by other people, that it's,

[01:30:16] **NAT GOODSPEED:** it's a very good thing that they're part of the standard. Um, I, this isn't part of the, um, the protocol, but I kind of feel like asking you [01:30:30] what additional Boost libraries would you think should be added to the standard and why you might think they're not there. Now, I don't know about Beast. Um, please remind me of the name of the Aseo author.

[01:30:45] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I, Christopher Koff. Christopher Koff. Um, Chris Koff is, um, a person who [01:31:00] I think many of us in WG 21 feel was very badly treated by WG 21. Um, he brought as EO it was going to be the standard C++ networking library, and he came from Australia. Um, I,

[01:31:27] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I don't think that during the time he was [01:31:30] engaged there were any WG 21 meetings anywhere near Australia. Um, and worked with the committee over a couple of years at least to try to get. Aseo or a version a library inspired by aseo, shall we say, to into the standard because, um, in this time it seems ridiculous that [01:32:00] C++ still has no standard networking library.

[01:32:06] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, and I think that as E was on track to become part of the standard and then, um, a whole new set of ideas came along and, um,

[01:32:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** you know, the ideas morphed and morphed and [01:32:30] became sender receiver. And there was an evening session at one of the recent WG 21 meetings. Um, in which someone presented Hello world as expressed in senders and receivers and the presentation was over an hour. There were like three pages of code and at the end of it, [01:33:00] one participant remarked that is the most complicated way of doing Hello World that I have could possibly ever have imagined.

[01:33:11] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, the sender receiver machinery is maybe the great universal adapter, but it's far from obvious how to use it well. Um, and [01:33:30] I think I.

[01:33:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I think there was this collective turning away from Chris and ASIO to this whole other set of ideas and the, the networking proposal just stalled and [01:34:00] Chris went away. Kind of discussed it with the whole thing. It seems to me that there have been more highly specialized, more, um,

[01:34:18] **NAT GOODSPEED:** domain specific libraries that are in the draft for C++ 26. Um.[01:34:30] 

[01:34:34] **NAT GOODSPEED:** The whole Blas thing, um, is a huge chunk of standard. Mm-hmm. And that took many committee meetings to just to wade through it. Um, and

[01:34:57] **NAT GOODSPEED:** how general is that? [01:35:00] Um, that's hard for me to answer except to say I've never bumped into a use case in my career. 

[01:35:12] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Andre Che, popular log viewed by WG 21 as policy application layer, not core language facility. Um, 

[01:35:23] **NAT GOODSPEED:** well, how about Stack Trace? Okay. Stack Trace is in the standard. Okay.[01:35:30] 

[01:35:33] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, so, and that was introduced during, um, my time in the, involved in WG 21. I, I mean, maybe that's the exception that proves the rule, but, um, you know, it took, um, the author to bring it and bring it again and bring it [01:36:00] again and work with the committee to try to establish wording that would dance around the committee's refusal to talk about a function call stack.

[01:36:17] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I think the wording ends up being something like. A sequence of invocation records or something [01:36:30] like that. Um, but um, that was brought in and was accepted. One of the phenomena, I think might be, um, that, um, Eric NR was working with Boost for the first couple of iterations of the Ranges library. At some point, Eric just [01:37:00] turned his attention from Boost to WG 21, um, and successfully got ranges into the standard.

[01:37:12] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, should the next iteration have gone through Boost is Boost a.

[01:37:26] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Necessary precursor. [01:37:30] Um, I think the question you're asking is what should be the role of Boost versus the role of the standard library that arrives with every implementation of the compiler? Mm-hmm. And it's a good question. I don't have, um, a pat answer to that. [01:38:00] Um, I think that I would ra, you know, if a Boost library that covers a specific bit of functionality that I need exists.

[01:38:13] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I would rather choose the Boost Library than any other open source library that I can pull from anywhere on the net, because I at least know that there has been a review process that people scrutinized that library before it became part of Boost. [01:38:30] Um, similar remarks can be made about the C++ standard library.

[01:38:38] **NAT GOODSPEED:** You could say that the scrutiny was more intense. Um,

[01:38:46] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** is there an anti-bot bias? Right? I'm going outside. Cut. Do that thing.

[01:38:55] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Some people have an anti-bot bias. Um, [01:39:00] and I've heard it expressed in the monolithic nature of the boost. Package. Um,

[01:39:16] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I believe there have been recent efforts to try to decouple some of the things that are not interdependent so that you can download a subset of the Boost libraries. I don't know what the status of [01:39:30] those efforts has been. As of the last time I updated to a current boost release, it was still a monolith.

[01:39:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And, um, there are people who just object to the way boost. Um, introduces stack frames into a [01:40:00] debugger and you pause and there's a trace back that includes a large number of stack frames for. Intermediates, um, you're looking at a call through a boost function object, and there's a bunch of internal functions, sub objects through which stuff is delegated [01:40:30] and some boost bind related things.

[01:40:32] **NAT GOODSPEED:** And in short, there are stack trace entries that have, um, long, long, hard to understand names and no apparent re relevance to the debugging problem that you're trying to face. You have to scroll past them to figure out what the, where in your code you're looking. Um, [01:41:00] and some people object to boost just on that basis.

[01:41:03] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I, I, I've talked to a couple of people about the Beman project. Um, I don't yet have a very clear sense of where that's going in part because it's a very recent effort. I think it's within the last year, maybe a little more. But, um, you have [01:41:30] to understand that I believe strongly in the, um, fiber functionality and in its ability to solve problems that, um, even C++ 23 can't solve reasonably.

[01:41:52] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I feel that, [01:42:00] um, if it does become part of the standard, it will be a, the. Most publicly beneficial thing I will have done in my whole life. Um, and

[01:42:24] **NAT GOODSPEED:** that belief, that feeling accounts [01:42:30] for my persistence, I, um, wish that I could say, oh yes, it went out with C++ 23 and you can use it right now. Um, that would've been awfully nice. It hasn't happened that way. Um, I,

[01:42:54] **NAT GOODSPEED:** I am not inclined to[01:43:00] 

[01:43:02] **NAT GOODSPEED:** point fingers and say, um, this. A person is to blame. I I do think that, um, committee process could be improved. Um, I think that

[01:43:29] **NAT GOODSPEED:** [01:43:30] maybe there's some,

[01:43:39] **NAT GOODSPEED:** there's some juggling of priorities that could take place. So, um, in a, in a good scheduler for operating system threads or, um, for tasks in general, if [01:44:00] some particular task has been ready. But has been starved for cycles for a long enough time. Its priority gets bumped up so that it will catch some cycles in the near future.

[01:44:14] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Um, I think the committee could borrow a lesson from that kind of implementation. The incubator groups were introduced though because, um, proposals were [01:44:30] being introduced that

[01:44:34] **NAT GOODSPEED:** were considered to be wasting the time of the design groups that were immature, that needed, um, further iteration by the authors of the proposal before even forwarding them to the design groups. Mm-hmm. Um, it was an attempt by the committee to, you know.[01:45:00] 

[01:45:01] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Well, oddly, to streamline things to, um, make better use of scarce committee attention for proposals that were ready. And the result is that you have more hurdles to jump through and you bring a new proposal. Um, I mean, it's sort of like the quote, um, I forget who it was, who famously said about, [01:45:30] um, C++ 11, I think.

[01:45:33] **NAT GOODSPEED:** Yes. The biggest complaint about C++ language is that it's too big and complex, so we simplified it by making it bigger. Um, that might have been Dr. Str.
