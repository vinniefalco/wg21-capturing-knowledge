[00:00:00] **HARRY BOTT:** No.

[00:00:09] **HARRY BOTT:** Oh. Um, I'm Harold Julius, bot Jr. People call me Harry, and I am the CEO of the C++ Alliance. Made my way in the world with C++, and also as a musician. I grew up in the Bronx, New York. And, um, my folks [00:00:30] who are my, uh, I'm, I'm, uh, very fond of talking about my folks, so I might go off on a tangent, but, uh, my, my mom, um, and dad were super influential for me.

[00:00:44] **HARRY BOTT:** My dad was a plumber, plumbing contractor. Um, he started working when he was 12, so he never went to high school. Mom, um, just a homemaker took care of us, both of 'em from the Bronx also. And, um, I have a sister. [00:01:00] And a younger sister who lives in Germany now. Yeah, dad. I mean, I, I think about them every single day.

[00:01:06] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, my dad was, you know, super, they were both extremely kind and loving people, very outgoing, always people in the house, always parties, always lots of fun. And, um, my dad especially, I mean my mom too, they both were, uh, um, I almost think of them as like saints. My father had [00:01:30] this unbelievable ability to just never see anything bad, you know, he was always very, he only saw the good in people.

[00:01:39] **HARRY BOTT:** He used to say things like it, they sounded trite. And as a kid, I used to think, no, you know, he would say, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. And you hear people say that. But he literally never said anything bad about anyone. I've never heard him say a bad word, um, about anyone ever. Not once.

[00:01:56] **HARRY BOTT:** And, and I, I remember being, being in a conversation, you [00:02:00] know, with someone who was obviously not nice or deranged or, you know, and after the person was gone, you know, I'd be like, did get a load of that guy. My dad would just be like, didn't see it, didn't even, didn't even notice the, the bad stuff. The crazy stuff.

[00:02:15] **HARRY BOTT:** It was actually a gift. It was like, and that's why I think it was, it was kind of like a, a saintly gift that he had the ability to just be so positive all the time. Um, specific things like, uh, if you're not 15 minutes [00:02:30] early, you're late. You know, that, that kind of thing. That, that I, um, I live by that. It's like one of my, it's a credo.

[00:02:38] **HARRY BOTT:** It's, it's something I I, I definitely abide by. I don't, I hate to be late. And I, and, um, yeah, I remember he and I, and I worked for him as a, as a. Uh, a young man, I guess when I was 14 and 15 in the summers as a, on the job site. And, uh, since he was the foreman, I remember the first day of work, he [00:03:00] dropped me off with some advice.

[00:03:01] **HARRY BOTT:** He was like, listen, he was gonna drop me off. He said, uh, I'll be back later in the day. He said, uh, just do me one favor when I come back on the job site. Don't, I don't want, wanna see you sitting down, so if you, there's nothing to do, I want you to pick up a broom and sweep. If there's nothing to sweep, then make some dust.

[00:03:19] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, do just don't ever be sitting around. So that, that, um, that was a, um, was actually Manhattan College, which is a, a college in the Bronx. And they were putting in a dorm. And I [00:03:30] remember like, I'm gonna make my dad proud. I'm gonna make him proud. So they had just put in some bathrooms, some, some showers, and I remember.

[00:03:37] **HARRY BOTT:** I was like, I didn't have anything to do, so I was gonna go clean the shower. So I was in there with a wet rag cleaning these shower stalls. And I, as kid, I didn't understand the, you know, basic things like, you know, there's a, there's a, a light bulb here, and I have a wet rag. That light bulb has got some dirt on it.

[00:03:53] **HARRY BOTT:** Let me clean it off. And so I, I go to clean it off and the light bulb bursts in my face. And I'm like, now I'm like, I don't know if [00:04:00] I'm blinded. And I stumble out of the, the doorway and I knock over a freshly painted door. And now the painters are mad and they're angry and they're chasing after me and I'm running down the hallway, you know, like, you know, this, this was my, my first job experience.

[00:04:13] **HARRY BOTT:** So, but I was just trying to do a good job. Computer science came much, much later than for me, than for most people. I, um, I fell in love with music as a, a very young man. And, um, 

[00:04:26] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** how so? 

[00:04:27] **HARRY BOTT:** Well, I, we, you know, we had, [00:04:30] I was gifted a guitar and, and kind of became obsessed with that. Um, spent a couple of summers, um, in high school, actually one summer in high school at Berkeley College of Music, and, um, spent a year at Julliard in college.

[00:04:45] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, I, um, was obsessed with music. I was, I was a music major in college and, um, graduated as, as a music major. In fact, um, I was the only music major of the year that I [00:05:00] graduated. Um, I went to Columbia and they, the music, the requirements for the music major were, were pretty steep. And, um, I was the only one who's fulfilled them that year.

[00:05:11] **HARRY BOTT:** So, so I, I got the, I got the music major and, um, sub only subsequently, um, I had a mus, my musical mentor, Jacque Lu mano, he, he was saying, boy, what do you wanna do? You wanna become a composer? He's like, I, why don't you, why don't you think about doing some math or something, something where you're actually [00:05:30] rewarded for your, your talent and your effort.

[00:05:33] **HARRY BOTT:** And so I, I always did whatever he told me to do. So I applied to the engineering school and um, to my great surprise was accepted. And, um, at that point bought a computer. Um, I bought a next cube, which was Steve Jobs's company next. And, um, I had a cool, um, math co-processor so I could do some computer synthesis on there.

[00:05:57] **HARRY BOTT:** It was a whopping 16 megabytes of, of [00:06:00] Ram on that, on that machine, which, uh, and, uh, and then I, I, uh, I studied computer science and did a master's in computer science. And I took, my first programming class was a C++ class, um, which was kind of like jumping into the deep end. And, um, John Lakos was the professor.

[00:06:19] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, I took the class and, and predictably, you know, got a, didn't do well, I got a c did. Um, and then. I thought, [00:06:30] wow, I, I should take that class again. Uh, so I went and talked to John and I said, I wanna be your ta. He said, but you got a C, you know? And I said, yeah, but it's in my first, my first programming class.

[00:06:39] **HARRY BOTT:** I said, oh, okay. You can, you can be the TA then. So, um, so I, I got to take, essentially take the class the second time. Mm-hmm. And that was my introduction to C++. I, uh, I was a big guitar player as a young man, and I was really fond of Andre Segovia, the classical guitarist. Got to see him twice, perform live, used to [00:07:00] listen to a lot of Segovia.

[00:07:00] **HARRY BOTT:** I was also into rock, rock music and, um, and jazz. Um, yeah, I listened to a lot of, I mean, I was kind of obsessed with, with, with, um, with music all through. I mean, I'm still obsessed with music. You know, it's interesting what, 'cause I, I've thought about why studying an instrument is useful. Um. Just in and of itself, it's, it's, it's a great discipline in that, [00:07:30] in that it's something that you have to, that you have to do by yourself, um, which is what coding also usually is.

[00:07:37] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, so if, as a young person, if you are exposed to a musical instrument, typically what happens is you go see a teacher and that teacher gives you some instruction, and then you go away for a week, and then you have to make progress. And then you come back a week later and the teacher observes your progress or says you didn't practice.

[00:07:58] **HARRY BOTT:** And so [00:08:00] it could be because, you know, frankly, I don't know about other cultures in the West. We don't, no one ever taught me how to study. I mean, I, at a certain point, I, you know, I, you know, I had a teacher in high school who was kind of like, okay, if you wanna study, you have to do this. But it's not, it's, it's not like it's, there's an accepted, accepted way to study, but when you study an instrument.

[00:08:20] **HARRY BOTT:** Y you have to figure out a way to, to get better you. And, and usually that means everyday practice by yourself, um, [00:08:30] and making daily incremental progress and, and then, and then once a week kind of having like a review of your progress. So I think that that's a, a very direct analogy to coding, to, to, um, you know, building something up on a daily basis.

[00:08:49] **HARRY BOTT:** And then over the course of weeks and months, seeing progress that results in something significant, potentially significant. I, uh, when I was the teaching [00:09:00] assistant for John Lakos, so I had to, I had to really do a lot of catching up for the computer science degree, so I didn't have any programming background.

[00:09:07] **HARRY BOTT:** And so I was taking classes in the summer and I tried to cram it all in. And I, when I was the, that second semester when I was teeing for John's course, I had, um. An offer from Goldman Sachs to join in their fixed income division. And I took the, took the job and there were actually, I think there were eight people [00:09:30] from Goldman taking the class.

[00:09:31] **HARRY BOTT:** John's John's class was very popular and it was, they, it was a closed circuit television to Bell Labs and also to IBM. So in addition to the in, in classroom audience, um, you know, audience, there were also dozens of other people taking the class. But there were eight people who were actually Goldman employees who were taking the class.

[00:09:53] **HARRY BOTT:** So I had, I used to hold office hours at, at my cubicle at, at work, um, at Goldman. And that was my first [00:10:00] job. I was there for a couple of years. Um, I wrote a, um, a, um, government bond trading system. There was, when it was their first, you know, it was right when we were automating different. Um, aspects of what was traditionally done o over the phone or on a, on a trading desk.

[00:10:20] **HARRY BOTT:** Hmm. And that's kind of one of the themes of, uh, of my career has been the, the automation of, of these things. I was there at the New York Stock Exchange when it, when it went fully electronic, [00:10:30] for example. So I started out at Goldman and then, um, was there for, you know, six or seven years. And a couple of my colleagues at Goldman, uh, started, made a startup.

[00:10:44] **HARRY BOTT:** And, uh, I was an investor in that. And, um, that was during the.com boom. Went to work for them. That was exciting. You know, the company, it's still a public company actually. We, um, we went public in [00:11:00] 2000 and, you know, rode the whole wave up and then down. And then how did that feel? Exhilarating. I, I remember, I, um.

[00:11:11] **HARRY BOTT:** I stopped working, actually, I went back to pursue a, a master's in classics at Columbia. So I studied, um, mostly Greek, but Greek and Latin. Uh, I was interested in reading, reading, um, Homer and, and others in the original. So, uh, I didn't finish the, the master's, but I, I did get a [00:11:30] chance to learn Greek and, and brush up on my Latin and learn a little Sanskrit.

[00:11:36] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, let's see. Um, then, uh, went to work for a, what they call, used to call a specialist company down on Wall Street. They called them market makers down and, um, wrote a, an options trading system for them. Um, that was Bear Wagner, bear Wagner specialists and ultimately was promoted to the [00:12:00] CIO there and had a nice, great team of, um, of developers, coders, uh, working for me.

[00:12:08] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um. Ran the technology for that company. It was about a 550 person company. Um, about 200 of them were traders and then eventually the, the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges that we worked with became electronic, which was, was a real game changer. [00:12:30] Like the whole world changed, especially for the guys who were trading on the floor.

[00:12:34] **HARRY BOTT:** They were no longer, you know, doing what they used to do. So that was a, that was, instead 

[00:12:40] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** they were doing what? 

[00:12:41] **HARRY BOTT:** Well, a lot of them, you know, lost their jobs, frankly. Um, but instead of act, so you remember the old, you know, videos of, um, you've seen, everybody's seen these videos of the New York, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where he had typically a man, a big guy who would be standing at a post with a, with a clerk or [00:13:00] two, and, you know, taking orders from, from brokers who were shouting and there would be people on the phone and it would be kind of a, the mini auction taking place, you know, but, but the human being in the middle.

[00:13:12] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, I remember during that period, um, sitting down with traders and I'm trying to convince, you know, tell them, you know, you're gonna, that's not gonna happen anymore. 'cause they, they're going to be doing, you know, a hundred trades a [00:13:30] second. You know, like, and I, I remember bringing in a metronome one day, putting it on 60.

[00:13:35] **HARRY BOTT:** And, you know, clicking at one, one click per second and asking these guys how many trades can you do in, in, in one of those clicks? And they're like, I can't, I can't do a trade now. I was like, is you just did a hundred. You know, the, there's the world is changing, like you're not gonna be able to get in the middle anymore.

[00:13:54] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, that was a, that was a crazy time down there, [00:14:00] down on Wall Street. I got my, my series seven at the time and was on the floor for a bit. And that was a pretty exciting, you know, not a very calm environment. Very um, you know, a crazy environment. In fact, I remember they, before part of getting my part of getting access to the floor and getting a badge was passing a physical, because they didn't, they they, they didn't want you going down there with a [00:14:30] weak heart.

[00:14:31] **HARRY BOTT:** 'cause um, it was, it was really that. Actually, I, I, I'm much, I'm, I'm a better manager than I am a coder. I was never, I came to it so late, I came to coding so late compared to everybody else. In fact, when I was in grad school, I thought, you know, accentuate the positive. 'cause you know, I was up against, I don't know how big the program was, a hundred, 200 people.

[00:14:56] **HARRY BOTT:** And I was definitely the least experienced out of [00:15:00] anyone in the, in the program in terms of having used a computer, frankly. So there was also, I mean, computer science is vast, so there's also theoretical computer science, and that's something I became interested in and wound up taking a, a lot of classes in.

[00:15:16] **HARRY BOTT:** So, in fact, 

[00:15:19] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** what's the difference there? 

[00:15:20] **HARRY BOTT:** So, computer theoretical, computer computer science has to do with, I mean, it's also, it's also a huge field. There's, there's coding, there's taking a class on C++ in writing [00:15:30] a program or a system or a library. There's also classes on algorithmic complexity or NP completeness, like for, for instance, which is a, a fascinating area about what problems are solvable by a computer.

[00:15:45] **HARRY BOTT:** So that was something that I became very interested in. There are a lot of problems, everyday problems that are what they call NP complete, which means that they're not solvable in finite amount of a finite amount of time and [00:16:00] space. And they're, they, they happen to be some very common everyday problems that, um, that are, that fall into that category.

[00:16:10] **HARRY BOTT:** And what I found super interesting about that field was one of the primary techniques of, of NP complete theory is when you have a, a problem that you don't know, you know, into which category it falls. One of the primary techniques is, is it's basically by analogy. You transform your given [00:16:30] problem into a known and be complete problem.

[00:16:33] **HARRY BOTT:** And, and do it in, in a, in a, in a, um, in a provable way, make a proof by analogy. You say, okay, this problem course maps onto this other problem, and therefore it is also an MP complete problem. It's a problem that can't be solved in finite space or time. And we, we need a heuristic in order to approach the problem.

[00:16:55] **HARRY BOTT:** We can't just, we can't just enumerate all of the possible [00:17:00] answers and pick the best one because that would, that would take an infinite, that would, that would take the amount of time that, that is longer than the, the time the universe has been in existence. Or we can't wait for, we can't wait for an enumeration of all the, of all the, the answers.

[00:17:15] **HARRY BOTT:** So we're gonna have to try to figure out a way of finding a, a, um, an optimal answer in other ways. Mm-hmm. But I found that super interesting. You know, there, there's a, there's a real art to, to that, um, I would say [00:17:30] thinking out loud. Um, there's problem solving this in this storytelling. There's something about, there's something about the intersection of those that interests me.

[00:17:40] **HARRY BOTT:** And I think, you know, now in retrospect, looking back at that very interesting aspect of NP complete work, that the, the idea of taking a, a problem a store, you know, a situation and, and, and making a jection [00:18:00] or a, or taking it and mapping it directly onto an existing one, and doing so successfully. Being able to say QED at the end and, and saying, okay, I've proven that this problem is, is a, another, just another version of one that we already have in this category.

[00:18:17] **HARRY BOTT:** There's something very, um, satisfying about that. Mm-hmm. It's not, it's not coding, it's, it's, it's doing computer science, but it's not writing any code. It's, it's, uh, it's more, uh, uh, and in fact, computer science [00:18:30] departments didn't exist. I mean, they at first were outgrowths of math departments, usually is usually in, you know, in the sixties and seventies.

[00:18:38] **HARRY BOTT:** There weren't computer science departments, there were math departments that, that enabled someone to use computer and study algorithms. So, a, after, uh, working with Bear Wagner, I was the CIO the, there was the, um, 2008 crash. The, the company was bought right before that by [00:19:00] Bear Stearns. So there was a lot going on.

[00:19:03] **HARRY BOTT:** There was, you know, so, so in a very short amount of time. I'm the CIO of this, this company on Wall Street that's bought out by a huge bank bear, uh, bear Stearns, which then, you know, you know the story and then that gets bought by Chase. And so now I'm working, now I'm, I'm working for Chase, and Chase owns this, this [00:19:30] subsidiary of 550 people on Wall Street, and I become an executive director at Chase.

[00:19:36] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, and eventually decide I want to go back to working in music. So I then took a position as music director at a traditional Latin mass and was choir director and organist for several years. And, uh, focused completely on, [00:20:00] on, on music. I like being, I like managing people. I mean, essentially if you're, you know, if you're a music director, I have a, I had a choir to conduct.

[00:20:10] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, we were, it was a very ambitious, um, choir. We used to perform a lot of music every week. We had a lot of rehearsing and it was a lot of stuff. Um, there was a lot of work for that job and it was obviously very different than the job as CIO, but in both cases I was [00:20:30] managing excellent people. 

[00:20:33] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Uh, what are you most proud of from that time?

[00:20:37] **HARRY BOTT:** Oh, that's a good, I mean, putting, putting together these performances that were quite good, um, with limited resources and limited time, very ambitious. Like I said, we, the, the choir was, was very ambitious, um, in that we would perform a lot of new music frequently. [00:21:00] So, um, we had a huge repertoire and, um, that took a lot of work that, 

[00:21:08] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** and so bot wise operations 

[00:21:10] **HARRY BOTT:** Oh, right.

[00:21:10] **HARRY BOTT:** So, yeah. Right. I'm so, yeah. I didn't completely stop working on. C++ and in finance, and I was sort of in high demand in the high frequency trading world. So I, I definitely, I, I started a con, did consulting company [00:21:30] and did some work with some, some of the top, uh, high frequency trading companies, like Get Co Geto was a company that was, um, super successful in that arena and got to work with them for a while and worked with a number of other, uh, high frequency trading firms down on Wall Street as a consultant for, for periods.

[00:21:54] **HARRY BOTT:** And I had a team that I brought with me from my days at, at Bear [00:22:00] Wagner and, uh, we would kind of go from place to place and um, and um, do, do our thing. 

[00:22:10] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Where were you based at that by that point in time? Manhattan. Okay. Yeah. When, when do you get to Florida and, and why? I 

[00:22:17] **HARRY BOTT:** moved to Florida 10 years ago because a friend built a recording studio, like the most beautiful recording studio that, I mean, it's, [00:22:30] people don't build recording studios anymore because you don't need, you can record in your home now, you, or a lot of times what people will do is they'll, they'll use a, a hall, they'll record in a hall or just use artificial reverberation or you know, they can, you can, a lot of the famous recording studios have closed 'cause they're expensive to run and they're frankly just not necessary.

[00:22:55] **HARRY BOTT:** So my, a really good friend of mine built this [00:23:00] beautiful recording studio and, um, invited me down and I went down and we did some, some projects together down there, and I stayed C++ Alliance is an organization, uh, 5 0 1 3 c. A charitable organization that supports the C++ community C++ ecosystem by funding open source libraries like Boost and critical C++, um, tooling.[00:23:30] 

[00:23:30] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, yeah, that's a C++ alliance. I became aware of Vinny, um, I guess over the years, just heard the name, you know, and then eventually was introduced by John Lakos. John, John introduced me. He was always talking about Vinny, um, how 

[00:23:50] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** so? 

[00:23:51] **HARRY BOTT:** Because John is also a big picture, you know, a big, big personality.

[00:23:56] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, and John is very interested in the future of c [00:24:00] plus plus. Um, as, as is Vinny, I think. Um, and John has his own initiatives. John works at, um, Bloomberg and is really. Guided by the, his vision for ensuring the safety, what does he call it? Um, safety, health and efficiency of the c, of the C++ language going forward.

[00:24:28] **HARRY BOTT:** He wants it to be the [00:24:30] language that you use in 2035 and not just, you know, become like a FORTRAN or a cobol. Um, 'cause there are would be successful languages out there now, like Rust and Swift that are coming, that where, where large organizations are saying, you know, C++ has, has, you know, we should, we, should we, we might wanna try a new approach to, to systems programming.

[00:24:59] **HARRY BOTT:** [00:25:00] And so C++ has come under some pressure also from regulatory agencies and from the government. So anyway, I'm, I'm, I'm getting way, uh, far afield from where Vinny is. I, I met Vinny a couple of months ago, um, through John, and that's how I came to know him. John suggested that I talk to, to Vinny just to get to know him and had a Zoom call with Vinny and was kind of surprised, you know, I, I didn't, you know, didn't know what to expect and, [00:25:30] um, thought, wow, this is, this is super bright guy.

[00:25:33] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, and also just like very personable. I was, I was kind of, you know, not expecting him to be such a, a lot of, you know, a lot of people who are coders or programmers or, you know, you don't necessarily get along with him so well, I got along super well with Vinny. I feel like, um, he's an easy person to get along with actually.

[00:25:59] **HARRY BOTT:** Um. [00:26:00] And also very bright. 

[00:26:02] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Did you say? Easy person to get along 

[00:26:03] **HARRY BOTT:** with? Yeah, I find him, I find him really super easy to get along with. He's like, you, you know where you stand with him? Um, yeah. And he's got a quick, I like that he is got a quick mind and he seems to be always kind of like, you know, onto the next thing, you know, like moving moves quick.

[00:26:24] **HARRY BOTT:** What, 

[00:26:24] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** what was the setting for this first meeting with him and what, and did all that stuff sort of strike you right off the [00:26:30] bat, or, 

[00:26:30] **HARRY BOTT:** yeah, yeah. It was, it was kind of, you know, how you, you kind of, sometimes you get a beat on a person in the first few minutes when you meet them. Um, John and I, John had had said I should talk to him, set up a Zoom call.

[00:26:43] **HARRY BOTT:** We, we discussed for a few minutes. I asked him about what he was working on. We just, we talked about it and um, he said he was looking to do, to do some great things in the C++ world, which is what I've been working on with John. And I said, wow. This [00:27:00] is interesting. And, um, when the opportunity came along for me to, to help lead this organization, I was, I jumped at the chance, you know, it's a really, um, it's a opportunity of a lifetime because I, I am excited about C++.

[00:27:18] **HARRY BOTT:** I'm excited about the future of C++. There's, there's a lot there. There's a lot there and there, and there's so much raw material at the Alliance. The, the people at the Alliance, there's some very [00:27:30] bright, that's a theme that you see in the C++ world. There's a lot of really bright people.

[00:27:35] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, it's a big community. C++ community is, is large. It's diverse. There's a lot of, you know, good solid engineering disputes that takes place, that take place. WG 21 is a good example. It, you know, sometimes it feels like it gets bogged down because you get a bunch of smart people in a room and talking about technical issues.

[00:27:56] **HARRY BOTT:** You're gonna get, you know. Some, [00:28:00] some conflicts. You gotta get some, but I feel like, um, when I met Vinny, I thought, well, here's a guy who, you know, he wants, he's, he's very interested in getting things done, very interested in, and, um, making some progress. Um, I mean, he didn't even have to pay. I was kind of like, Hey, you know, this, we, we can, we could do some good things.

[00:28:26] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, he, he, I mean he, when I, when [00:28:30] I learned more about the alliance and who was involved and some of the, the people involved, I thought, wow, you know, there's, you know, there's all this, these, these great boost assets that are there. There's so much potential there. There's so much potential with the group of people who are involved, the staff engineers and the, and the career people who have been around the alliance around.

[00:28:56] **HARRY BOTT:** He's got a, he's got a, a great team around him and, [00:29:00] um, the fact that he wanted to, to go to the next level, um, and that was, that was key. And when I saw that, I really leapt at the chance to be a part of that. Yeah, that's a big question. Um, we sat down and, uh, I tried to understand, you know, where, you know, where Boost is currently.

[00:29:25] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, I had a, a basic idea. I've always known about Boost. You know, boost is, you know, it's legendary. [00:29:30] It's, it's, you know, the, the, it was using their libraries, boost libraries for, you know, back in when I first started out. And so, um, knowing the current state of affairs and, and seeing. Where things are right now, where they could go, sat down with Vinny a couple times to kind of just brainstorm and came up with ideas about expanding the reach of, of Boost, you know, making it and the ecosystem expanding, you know, [00:30:00] improving the ecosystem, expanding our reach worldwide, really partnering with anybody who will, who will be partners with us, and, and doing a lot of outreach and sponsoring, um, excellent developers and, and making the libraries world class.

[00:30:20] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, these, these libraries are world class libraries that are, that will enable developers to any developer to write secure and high [00:30:30] performance, um, applications. You know, there's, there's a lot of inertia. There are, you know, a hundred and. 60 odd 180. I mean, I, I don't know the exact number actually. Um, right now there are a lot of libraries and there's a lot of, of, of, of collective wisdom embedded in those libraries.

[00:30:54] **HARRY BOTT:** Some libraries are much more, um, popular than others. But, um, [00:31:00] you know, there's, there's a, a lot of inertia that builds up over the course of decades of, of these libraries in use. So some of them are actively maintained, some of them are, are not. And part of the process going forward is figuring out where we want to put the effort to expand and, you know, where we want to clean things up.

[00:31:22] **HARRY BOTT:** And there are other efforts as well as to, to, you know, to reach around the world and make sure that the 10 million [00:31:30] odd C++ developers around the world are aware of what we're doing and what, what's available. And, um. And I'm, I'm super excited about that. You know, about where we, one of the things that we've done initially, I mean, I've been in the role for, on the order of weeks now, uh, it's one of the first things we've already done is, is, uh, translating some of the documentation is the Chinese, because that's a, you know, a good portion of the, of the world's C++ developers are, are in China.

[00:31:59] **HARRY BOTT:** [00:32:00] And, uh, we're here at WG 21 and there's, there's very little rep. I mean, there's no representation from China as far as I can tell. So, um, it'd be interesting to have more give and take with Chinese developers and, and, um, there's, I think, an untapped potential there for, for library development coming from China.

[00:32:27] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah, I think, well, first of all, I, again, [00:32:30] I, you know, it's. I'm only a couple of weeks into the, the job, I'm still getting my sea legs. I'm still figuring out what's going on. Um, there's a lot that's happened since 2011. Um, in the standards committee there used to be quite a bit smaller. It used to be, you know, a, a much smaller group of people who were part of the standardization process.

[00:32:52] **HARRY BOTT:** Now there are 20 something odd study groups. There are hundreds of, of standard committee members. [00:33:00] So it makes getting anything done, frankly, uh, a, a much bigger, uh, task. Today we were, we we're dealing with national body comments on contracts, which is something that has been proposed for a long time, and right now it looks like it's poised to be in C++ 26.

[00:33:23] **HARRY BOTT:** But, you know, there are people who are vocal opponents and, um, the proponents have to have to deal with [00:33:30] every single. Comment individually and, and, and put them to rest. All the, the questions and concerns about introducing con contracts. Um, C++ is a big language. It's a, it's a big language. And, um, the, in C++ 26, there's also reflection, which is a huge feature.

[00:33:52] **HARRY BOTT:** That's another huge feature. So, um, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the, the standards committee is [00:34:00] enormous. It's a, it's a, it's an enormous number of people involved, um, trying to organize and get anything done. It's, it's really, um, it's a huge challenge. And the cadence is, it sounds slow, three years, every three years, but it winds up being.

[00:34:20] **HARRY BOTT:** Pretty breakneck. The, the, the pace at which papers are written and digested and responded to and votes are [00:34:30] taken. So there are, the WG 21 has three meetings per year. So, you know, a three year cadence means that you get, you know, nine or so meetings. Um, and it sounds like a lot, but it's, it winds up being, it winds up being, um, down to the, down to the last minute on, um,

[00:34:59] **HARRY BOTT:** um, [00:35:00] on all these new features. So things, so things, so the, yeah, the golden age, you know, there was, you know, the library was still nascent. There wasn't, it was still, there was still a lot of room there for, for basic things to be introduced. Um. Yeah, just untangle that. I would say, I would say first and foremost, set the stage.

[00:35:26] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, you've got a hundred, uh, let's say, let's, [00:35:30] let's just call it 150 to 200. I don't know how many members the standards committee has, but there's a hundred and there's 150 people attending a meeting, and they're all technically savvy. They're, I mean, honestly, some of the, the brightest, brightest people you, you you'll ever wanna meet, many of them are super, super bright.

[00:35:51] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, everybody has, uh, you know, bring something to the table and they're coming together and, and trying to come to [00:36:00] agreement. Um, and the best you can hope for is violent agreement on, on a lot of these things. Um, there really no, there were no layups there. Those were, those were all done. All, all the very simple, you know, no-brainers were taken care of in 2011.

[00:36:16] **HARRY BOTT:** And before, what we're doing now is, and, and these, it gets to a philosophical question about how do you want to approach the, the language C++ is, it's almost like a, a foundational technology at this point. [00:36:30] It's like, it's interesting to think about. It's, it's, it's 40 years old when you think about when C++ was.

[00:36:38] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, VNA started writing C++ probably in the seventies, but he didn't call it C++ until the early eighties. So approximately 40 years, um, 40 years or so of C++. That's a long time for a technology, I don't know. But is C++ a technology? It's a, it's a programming language that is foundational.

[00:36:58] **HARRY BOTT:** It's, you know, [00:37:00] when you talk about high frequency trading, it's really the only game in town. When you talk about, you know, I mean, I'm not so expert in game development, but I, you know, there are certain domains for which C++ is, is where people. That's where you have to go and you have to use C++.

[00:37:17] **HARRY BOTT:** And it's kind of remarkable that, that it's, it's lasted so long and it's got a vibrant community that every three years votes on ex enlarging the surface area of the language. [00:37:30] So that, that alone is an issue because every year people go to school and they learn, hopefully they learn C++ they learn python, they learn other things.

[00:37:41] **HARRY BOTT:** But at some point someone is new to the language. And when you in, when you give them a language that's been around for 40 years, that is increasingly, that is increasing in size every three years. Uh, contracts alone, reflection alone are enough to keep someone super busy. An expert, [00:38:00] C++ someone who already knows and is expert in C++ to, for them to come in and, and get their brain around contracts and or reflection is a chore.

[00:38:10] **HARRY BOTT:** So for someone who's new to the language. Yeah, that's, that's, it's, it's daunting. It's gotta be, and this is something that I think that the community has to wrestle with. WG 21 has to consider every time something is added to the language, that it makes the learning process the more daunting [00:38:30] and, um, 

[00:38:33] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** pardon me.

[00:38:34] **HARRY BOTT:** It's okay. So, yeah. I, so it's getting 

[00:38:38] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** harder, it sounds like. 

[00:38:40] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah. It's, it's, it's, there's, you know, there and then at the same time while they're, you know, adding functionality, there's also adding things to make it a more modern appearing language. Let's do, let's add the, the syntactic sugar, let's add this, this, uh, the ability to do something [00:39:00] else.

[00:39:00] **HARRY BOTT:** And, and every time that's done. You know, it, it, it, um, it increases what I, I would call the surface area of the language. You know, like the, the, the, the amount of things that one has to, to learn in order to really know C++ it be, at a certain point, it becomes just a huge topic that is, that no one can really be expert in the entire thing.

[00:39:20] **HARRY BOTT:** I think, um, I can say from what I, what I've seen of Vinny is that he's very practical. He's, um, he's a sharp guy [00:39:30] and, um, very sharp and um, like, is results oriented, very, very practical. Kind of like, okay, that's, I mean, that's, you know, that's what makes him great as someone, as a proponent of Boost, you know, 'cause Boost is really there to, to be practical solutions like world class practical solutions that developers can use to build high performance systems and reliable ones.

[00:39:58] **HARRY BOTT:** So, [00:40:00] you know, boost is really, um. It's like a proving ground. Like I, I, it's, it's like, why would you, you know, want to be involved with Boost? Well, there's, you know, the boost, um, review process, which is kind of like the, the proving ground, you know, so the, you know, there's, there's something about that process that, that sets it apart from other libraries, and that's what makes it [00:40:30] special.

[00:40:30] **HARRY BOTT:** And, you know, I seen things in news groups and, and, um, discord channels, slack channels, talking to people, just, uh, and I heard different sides of the story. I'm, I'm very much focused on the, on the future. So, um, I, I don't even think I could, could give a good, a good, um, summary of what happened. Um. [00:41:00] I, I, it's not, it's not willful ignorance, but it's definitely like, um, I think I am really, really focused on the future and trying to be, you know, I, I'm a, I feel like, you know, like there's, it's a huge community, C++, it's, there's, there's a lot of diversity.

[00:41:20] **HARRY BOTT:** There's a lot of different ideas, a lot of big personalities, and obviously things, things like this are gonna, are gonna happen, you [00:41:30] know, and people just have to move on, you know, you have to, and, and I think actually the, the best thing would be to just con just, just to work together, you know, to make the, there's, there are outside forces that are.

[00:41:43] **HARRY BOTT:** A, a raid against C++ right now, and the, you know, whether or not there are legitimate concerns. I mean, there are some, some concerns about the, the safety of the C++ language. There are the US government, the, you know, other, other governments and, and, and regulatory bodies have [00:42:00] issued papers and warnings about using C++.

[00:42:03] **HARRY BOTT:** And we have to address those, those issues we have to, to deal with them. So that's what I'm focused. Oh. I think, um, the future of Boost is bright. I, I feel like, like Boost in particular has got, there's so much, there's so much. There that we can use to, to, to propel forward. Uh, I'm thinking C++ is more of the, is the target.

[00:42:26] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, boost is, is not a, is not boost is, uh, is [00:42:30] in a good position right now. Boost is, you know, there's a lot of pent up, you know, information and, and, uh, a lot of great, a lot of great material there. That with the right positioning can really, can really make a, a big impact on the ecosystem and the future of c plus.

[00:42:47] **HARRY BOTT:** Plus future of C++ is what I'm concerned about. And, um, and like, i I, for the reasons I mentioned that, you know, the US government and other governments are, you know, [00:43:00] concerned rightly so for some reasons, you know, that, that there are, um, what they, what they call, um, threat vectors that are embedded into C++ that, that it's been around so long that people know how to exploit.

[00:43:15] **HARRY BOTT:** And, uh, there are different approaches and, and the C++ foundation was a sponsor of the Safe C plus bus initiative with ROM Baxter, and that was a, a valiant attempt to try to make some inroads and, [00:43:30] and, and address the safety, some of the, some of the safety problems head on. Um, Sean's a brilliant guy and, um, it didn't get the traction that it, um, it could have, but, um, there are other approaches out there that are gonna, I think, suffice to make C++ acceptably safe.

[00:43:52] **HARRY BOTT:** So 

[00:43:52] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** how, how are you tackling that one 

[00:43:55] **HARRY BOTT:** so, well, right now, I, I've been a part of the SG 21, the [00:44:00] contracts, uh, study group for the last couple of years. And I think contracts is going to make it into C++ 26. Um, that's a big part of. Making C++ Safer is having the ability to embed contracts into the language.

[00:44:17] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, you know, there's more, there's more in C++ 29, you know, once contracts are in use for a little bit and we get some practical experience, we'll be able to [00:44:30] en enlarge that effort and make the, make the language safer. So, just weeks after joining the Alliance, I attended the CPP Con, uh, just weeks after joining the Alliance, I attended CPP Con 2025 and, um, met in person, some of the staff engineers.

[00:44:53] **HARRY BOTT:** Met John Cal, met Alan, um, some other people. Um, it [00:45:00] was actually my first C PPP Con. I had never attended C PPP Con. That was interesting experience. I mean, I think it's part, I mean, partly it's. Due to, maybe it's due to the, the, to COVID, but also the fact that, you know, C++ is a, is such a huge language.

[00:45:18] **HARRY BOTT:** That, and, and, and, you know, boost has been around for so long that, you know, you've been, I've been using a Boost library for a decade and, and I, you know, I know I, I know of the [00:45:30] author, but then, you know, you, you finally get a chance to meet, you know, meet the, the author. That's, it's exciting. Um, yeah. 

[00:45:40] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Well, I mean, what's, what was your mission?

[00:45:43] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** It's, you were very, still very new. So how would you describe what you went out there to do on behalf of the Alliance? 

[00:45:50] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah, that was, for me, it was the kind of reconnaissance mission, you know, I wanted to find out, you know, where, what was the standing of the alliance and, and who was, uh, who was, [00:46:00] um, willing to work with us and wanted to work with us, and who was excited to work with us and who was wary or.

[00:46:08] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, yeah, it was, 

[00:46:11] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** any surprises there? 

[00:46:13] **HARRY BOTT:** No, I kind of, I think I went into it, um, well informed, I think I knew, you know, um, basically the lay of the land and, and it was good to get out there and meet some people in person and, um, just, you know, face to face and, [00:46:30] and see what people's issues were and, and how they wanted to go forward and, and, and move forward.

[00:46:36] **HARRY BOTT:** I'm, I'm feeling pretty positive about the prospect of partnering up with different members of the community and, and making some real progress. 

[00:46:47] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** Um, what were some themes of those conversations? 

[00:46:52] **HARRY BOTT:** Well, um, you know, library development, standardization, um, I, um, [00:47:00] yeah, basically, you know, the idea of how, how do, how do libraries become standard?

[00:47:06] **HARRY BOTT:** Standard libraries nowadays, it's, um, it's a different world meeting different people. Um, one of the guys I met there was Matt, who, who's, uh, a Polish National Body member who's got a library, uh, units library. And we, um, we've been talking, he's here at the, at the, at WG 21, uh, being sponsored by the Alliance, which I think is a great, a great, [00:47:30] uh, feather in the alliance's cap to bring such a excellent engineer, make it possible for him to attend in person.

[00:47:38] **HARRY BOTT:** And, uh, even though right now the focus is on, uh, C++ 26, so there isn't talk about adding new libraries, um, you know, actively at this, at this, um, meeting, but there are in-person op opportunities for him to meet in person with people about that. Yeah. Um, you know, about standardization. [00:48:00] I, I, um, I really feel like.

[00:48:04] **HARRY BOTT:** Like Daisy and Jeff and all these other people who have so much experience and a lot of knowledge and, um, are in a position to, to help move things forward. So I feel like the, the future looks positive to me. The, the, the past is, it's just, it's, it's, it's already, it's done. You know, it's, it's, uh, and [00:48:30] we're ready to move, to move forward and collaborate and, and have a positive working relationship.

[00:48:37] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, yeah, it's sort of the, the Locus four for information about the Boost Libraries and about Boost initiatives, which are expanding in scope both the libraries and the initiatives. And, um, I think the main takeaway, the main message is that, that the C++ Alliance is, it's promoting [00:49:00] the. The health of the C++ ecosystem, not just by funding development of world class libraries, but through other initiatives.

[00:49:10] **HARRY BOTT:** Like, like I mentioned, the, even the translation of the Chinese, uh, into, into Chinese of the, the documentation. You know, I don't know the, the exact numbers, but it's probably, I don't know, there's, there are several million Chinese C++ developers, and as I mentioned [00:49:30] earlier, there's no representation at WG 21.

[00:49:34] **HARRY BOTT:** Um, so there's an untapped potential there. You know, there's, there's obviously a lot of really talented C++ developers in China, and, uh, we would love to bring them into the fold, into the, into the, the Boost world. Have them as, I mean, they, they are using the Boost libraries where like 40, I think 40% of our traffic comes from, from China, our web traffic.

[00:49:59] **HARRY BOTT:** So, [00:50:00] uh, we would love to see some libraries being developed by Chinese developers and, and obviously want those libraries being used in China. Not every, I mean, a lot in China, a lot of the developers aren't, don't have English, English skills. And, um, so we've got a team, an excellent talented team using a, a translation pipeline with the human in the loop, kind of going through our documentation and making sure that it's top notch in [00:50:30] Chinese and kind of just bringing more people into more developers into the fold and into the, the boost world.

[00:50:40] **HARRY BOTT:** Love about that. Yeah. I think that Vinny's super open to, to, to just moving forward and making the future of C++ viable and, and exciting. So, like I mentioned Matt Poosh, you know, sponsoring his presence here. That's huge. I think he was a great. You know, generous way [00:51:00] of, of, uh, of bringing, um, bringing an excellent developer from, from Poland here to talk about his, his units library, which is exciting.

[00:51:10] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah, we, we've got a couple of different initiatives in the works. One that I'm really excited about is in, involved with compiler writing. So in the big picture, take a sec. Take a step back. C++ the standards committee involves, it essentially has four [00:51:30] tracks, or I should, let me say the C++ standards committee has to do with the language, but it also has to do with the standard library.

[00:51:40] **HARRY BOTT:** So, and they're, and they, they intersect. So a lot of the time, if you wanna do something in a library, you need to make something happen in the standard to make that, that library facility possible. So right now there's something called trivial relocation that involves [00:52:00] touching both the language and the library.

[00:52:03] **HARRY BOTT:** So it turns out, and this was something that would surprise me, um, in my recent work in the last couple of years, I was involved with recruiting a team of compilers, compiler writers. And, um, I discovered that the, the pool of compiler writers is quite limited. There's not a, a large number of compiler writers, and there are very few people, younger [00:52:30] people, in fact, very, very few young people are, are, are working on writing compilers and, and updating compilers.

[00:52:37] **HARRY BOTT:** So there are two main open source compilers. There's GCC and clang. And, um, there's just a handful of people working on, on each, which is really kind of, um, um, shocking when you, when you look at how much. The, you know, the funnel narrows when you get to this handful of [00:53:00] people who are, who are, um, responsible for implementing what WG 21 says is C++.

[00:53:08] **HARRY BOTT:** So, um, what we're, one of the things we want to do with, with the Alliance is sponsor some younger compiler developers have, provide them with mentor mentors and, um, and, and bring along the next generation of compiler writers, because that's an essential part of the ecosystem. The health of the [00:53:30] ecosystem, the, the, uh, vibrancy of the ecosystem is, it's one thing to specify the C++ language as they do every three years in the, in the committee, but unless you have practical implementation experience, then it's all for naught.

[00:53:45] **HARRY BOTT:** There's, it's no, there's no point unless you have people who are out there. Implementing the, the language. You know, there's, there's, like I said, the language side and the, the library side. So they're both important. [00:54:00] And the Boost has traditionally been the, you know, dealing with libraries and getting libraries into the standard and providing world class libraries for developers.

[00:54:11] **HARRY BOTT:** I'd like to see the, the, the alliance also improving the ecosystem by helping with the com, the compiler writing. Yeah. Right now I'm in Kona, Hawaii. It's November, 2025. This is WG 21 standards committee [00:54:30] meeting. We're getting ready to, to ship or to specify what goes into C++ 26. Um, right now there are some issues to be resolved with regards to.

[00:54:47] **HARRY BOTT:** Contracts and trivial relocation and reflection. These are some big features that are gonna be going into C++ 26. Um, and contracts is one big one that has [00:55:00] been talked about for years. It was, I think initially in C++ 20 and then taken out at the last minute. I don't know the exact, the exact history.

[00:55:08] **HARRY BOTT:** So Kona is a big, it's a big deal. Uh, Kona 2025. Um, in terms of w in terms of C++ history, this is a, this is a big, eventful, impactful meeting. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. I guess, you know, herb, herb Sutter has been the, um, convener for [00:55:30] probably 20 years or more. Um, and he's appointed Guy Davidson as his successor and guy has actually decided to have sort of, I think vice conveners.

[00:55:43] **HARRY BOTT:** I'm not sure if that's the. Um, but, um, Jeff Garland and Nina Rands are gonna be helping out. I think, you know, guy has some very big shoes to fill and, uh, John Spicer is, is also, uh, he's, he was one of the, um, [00:56:00] the leaders of SG 21, the contracts group. John is, uh, and also head of, um, EDG compiler. Um, and so he's retiring and, um, so, um, it was interesting last night there was an orientation where there were some new people.

[00:56:17] **HARRY BOTT:** I think, I think in terms of historically, the, the attendance here is a little lighter than usual. Um, not exactly sure why, but there were probably a half dozen or maybe [00:56:30] more or somewhere, something around that knew people who raised their hands and said it was their first meeting, maybe, maybe eight people or so.

[00:56:38] **HARRY BOTT:** So some people are leaving, some people are. Some, some, there are some new people. Yeah. I, you know, it's a real unknown. I, you know, herb was a known quantity and he was super, he was an excellent convener and, um, responsible for a lot of, you know, uh, the progress in C++ [00:57:00] right now. Um, we're, we're waiting to see, you know, guy hasn't taken over yet.

[00:57:04] **HARRY BOTT:** He's, you know, he's taking over some responsibilities at this meeting. But, um, it's still herb's. It's still herb's, uh, committee at this point. And, um, and they announced today that Nina is stepping down as the secretary, so they're looking for a new secretary. And, um, so there's, things are moving around. I, I don't imagine we'll see dramatic changes that's not, it's not necessarily the wrong, the wrong way.

[00:57:27] **HARRY BOTT:** I think it's, it's, it's been a while [00:57:30] since, um, the, the, the library standardization process has, has bogged down. Um. You know, 2011 was a, was a, a watershed year because it's kind of the dividing line of modern C++. I mean, modern C++ is, you know, 2011 was the, the point at which it became, when, when, when people talk about using modern C++, and it's interesting to, to see when you look at the, [00:58:00] there's a yearly C++, uh, uh, questionnaire that goes out and you look at who's using C++ 98, who's using C++ 1117, who's, who's not ever going to, you know, like what percentage of the, of the C++ population is, is stuck on C++ 11 20 11 and not planning to ever move past it.

[00:58:27] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, there's, there's, [00:58:30] there's a, a vast array, uh, there's a, a vast array of users out there with different. Problems they need to solve. And, um, so it's, uh, it's, it's an interesting, it's, it's such a conundrum because you've got such a huge community and the, the, um, the number of users, the number of users who are kind of stuck with one version of the language, the, [00:59:00] the desire to push forward with new features and have new versions of the language every three years.

[00:59:06] **HARRY BOTT:** It's, um, you know, virtually, no, everybody's somewhat behind. You know, nobody's, nobody's using C++. I shouldn't say no one, nobody. But, um, you know, industrial usage of C++ 23 is, is not very high. Um, and it's surprising sometimes to see how, how [00:59:30] entrenched the older versions of the language are.

[00:59:32] **HARRY BOTT:** But, you know, there are reasons for that. Yeah, I, I'm, I'm, I'm anticipating a really vibrant boost world and a really vibrant C++ world. Like a lot of things have to go right, but I think we're, we're poised to, to have those things go right. We've got great team, um, great collection of minds over at the C++ Alliance.

[00:59:55] **HARRY BOTT:** Really bright people. It's, it's, it's humbling actually to, to kind of [01:00:00] be in touch with all these just really, really brilliant minds and, um, and talented people kind of pushing forward. And I think, yes, standardization, we can get that ball rolling again. Um, but I mean, more than anything, being, being, being boost means, being a boost library means you've gone past the boost review process and it's, it's kind of a rite of passage for certain.

[01:00:28] **HARRY BOTT:** It certainly has been for certain [01:00:30] well-known developers. Um, it's something where you can, it's like a, it's a badge of honor. It's something where you get attention by, by going through that process, you get the right kind of attention. It can be, it has to be a difficult process. It because, you know, anything, anything worth having is gonna be, you know, precious and difficult.

[01:00:53] **HARRY BOTT:** So to, and, and of course in the, in the realm of engineering, you know, you have to pass muster [01:01:00] and, um, that process is tried and true and it's, um, that's something we want to continue. Obviously we want to, we want to continue to have world-class, excellent libraries and, uh, make them more available, um, more pertinent, more useful for, um, a vast of a wider array of users.

[01:01:25] **HARRY BOTT:** We wanted to attract new. Library contributors, and we [01:01:30] want to do an outreach, you know, in, like I mentioned in China, we want to, we want to, um, I think success looks like, you know, the Boost ecosystem being more vibrant, having some new, new libraries, updated libraries, having a, a bigger user base, having more application developers using Boost.

[01:01:53] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah, I think, I think, uh, if, if I, if I can be successful in making it easier for, [01:02:00] for Bright Minds to contribute, that would be, that's really the, you know, I feel like that's part of a, a big part of my role is to make sure that I remove the obstacles for that. Taking place. Like, you know, if somebody has a great idea and it's able to pass muster in the boost review process, then let's get them producing a, a Boost library and let's get it out there and, and let's publicize it and, and get application developers using it and, and improving the, the [01:02:30] safety, the, the, um, accessibility, the performance of, of developers all over the world.

[01:02:37] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** And what, what is, why are you doing it? 

[01:02:39] **HARRY BOTT:** Yeah, this is really the, this is like a role of my li a role of a lifetime for me. It's, um, it's, it's very exciting. You know, I've, I've had different positions in, as a coder, as a manager, as, um, as, um, working in, in software engineering, working in high [01:03:00] frequency trading, working in, in all different, in startups.

[01:03:04] **HARRY BOTT:** Um. And, um, being able to actually influence the future of C++, which is what the C++ Alliance is doing. The C++ Alliance has a role to play, a major role to play in the future of C++. So that's really exciting. It's humbling. It's, it's, and it's fun. It's a, it's a lot of, um, it's, it's a lot of fun.

[01:03:26] **HARRY BOTT:** It's a lot of, it's a lot of work, but it's, you know, it's [01:03:30] also very rewarding to be able to, to make some real progress. T plus plus is, it's one of those things, it's like, I was thinking of, I was, before the interview, I was thinking, just thinking about, I was talking to a friend who's not a technology person at all, and I was explaining C++.

[01:03:46] **HARRY BOTT:** It's kinda like electricity, you know, like, it's like it's a technology that's so a part of your life that you don't even realize it until it's, I mean, you don't even realize how much of the world [01:04:00] runs on C++. Like, I mean, really critical things. In fact, this is, I mean, it's, it's a silly anecdote, but when I first started looking for compiler engineers, I, I often will do this when I, when I start any endeavor, I'll make a guess, I'll say, and I, and I, I had a guy who was working with me, I said, Hey, how many compiler engineers are there in the world?

[01:04:24] **HARRY BOTT:** You know? And so it's like, hmm, let's see. [01:04:30] There's, you know, 10 million C++ programmers, compiler, engineers. I don't really know that many, but there's gotta be. And the, you know, after deliberating for a while, I was like, 5,000. There's gotta be 5,000 compiler engineers. And then I said, as a, as a thought experiment, I said, what if there was a compiler engineering convention in Vegas, you know.

[01:04:52] **HARRY BOTT:** And he was like, yeah, what are you getting at? I was like, what if Isis like, you know, attacked the convention and, and wiped out all these compiler vendors, like, why [01:05:00] would they want to do that? I was like, because the world would come to a stop. Like if you, if you didn't have any C++ compiler engineers, then like, just think about the implications of that.

[01:05:11] **HARRY BOTT:** And we were like, wow, holy cow. That, that is kind of scary. You know, like there's only 5,000 of 'em. And then I actually sat down and started to try to reach out to compiler engineers and to find, find them to hire them. And I was like, wow. There's, there's like 50. [01:05:30] It's like, and there's like maybe 25 who are doing it on a day-to-day basis.

[01:05:35] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, like the, the number of, and I, and I was almost like, like, let's not tell anybody, you know, because, because, you know, like that's like a John Grisham novel, or it's like a, you know, like you could have a plane with all the ka compiler riders in the world, you know, like that, you know, like, um, because, you know, nuclear reactors or, or seven 40 sevens or, you know, the, the world's [01:06:00] stock markets, you know, these, these are things that all run on C++.

[01:06:04] **HARRY BOTT:** And, um, anyway, I don't know how I got off into that tangent. Um, 

[01:06:09] **RAY NOWOSIELSKI:** it's a good tangent though. Okay. Yeah, that was a great tangent. The tangent I was looking for. Okay. 

[01:06:14] **HARRY BOTT:** Good, good. What does it matter? I don't think people understand. I, I, I mean, I think even software engineers, people who use Python for instance, don't realize how much Python is written in C++, or, or I mean, C++.[01:06:30] 

[01:06:30] **HARRY BOTT:** There's a lot of weight. What resting on the C++ language, it's, it's an important intellectual commodity that is under the radar. It's like, I, I, I mean, it's an exaggeration to say it's like electricity, but it is interesting that it's been around for so long and it is, it's just gonna be around for a long time.

[01:06:51] **HARRY BOTT:** And the question, one of the questions now about the viability of C++ is, is it gonna become like, like COBOL and, and [01:07:00] FORTRAN where it's, it's supported, but, you know, you don't start new projects in C++. And my goal, the goal I think of, of, of, you know, of the Alliance and of people who wanna cC++ Thrive is to make it a language that is viable for new projects, for the foreseeable future that you, that you want to write in C++.

[01:07:23] **HARRY BOTT:** That you don't want to just maintain the, the. You know, million, billions of lines of code that have [01:07:30] been written in C++, but you want to continue to write new code. And, you know, something we haven't talked about, um, it's maybe just tangentially related, but AI revolution that's going on really does favor incumbent languages because there's such a large code base to learn from.

[01:07:50] **HARRY BOTT:** So it's interesting, you might, you know, just off the top of your head, say, well, ai, it would, it would, um, favor new languages or it would, it would encourage new [01:08:00] languages, but there's this huge library to use, um, of C++ out there to learn from. And, um, it, so there's a lot of exciting things to be done in C++ with, with artificial intelligence as well.

[01:08:17] **HARRY BOTT:** Hmm. And it's something we're thinking about. We have, we have some ideas, nothing we can share at this point, but, you know, we're, we're, we're. We're thinking about these, these things, and it's exciting. You know, [01:08:30] I'm, I'm thinking by analogy, why does anybody care that COBOL or Fortran, um, are no longer nobody?

[01:08:38] **HARRY BOTT:** Nobody writes a COBOL or fortran. They're, people get paid a lot of money to, to maintain code in, in COBOL and Fortran, but nobody's, those languages are, they're languishing. See, and the, I don't know that the general public would, would care if it's, it's, it's kind of [01:09:00] like as long as it works, you know, as long as it, it's, it's so embedded.

[01:09:05] **HARRY BOTT:** You know, I, I, I, I think it's one of those situations where like a, a very esoteric top, a very esoteric topic affects daily, everybody's daily life. And people don't realize it. People don't realize how much they rely on C++ and how much. It undergirds so much of the world. [01:09:30] Yeah. Even, I mean, just talking about the world's stock exchanges, you know, that alone is, is, is really huge.

[01:09:38] **HARRY BOTT:** Not really. I mean, honestly, I, I, yeah. The, um, the BSL is, is ideal. Is, so what is that? That's the Boost software license. So, um, one of the, one of our initiatives is to, is to increase knowledge about BSL and to get more people to incorporate, you know, the [01:10:00] use the BSL license, the B use the, the BSL. Um, so that's one of our initiatives.

[01:10:06] **HARRY BOTT:** One of the, the things that we're doing in the last couple of weeks and we're gonna be doing going forward, is to increase corporate and industrial knowledge of what it is. Mm-hmm. And why it's beneficial to adopt. It's, it's beneficial for, you know, for all involves, it, it, um, BSL [01:10:30] is the, the cleanest way of licensing your software.

[01:10:35] **HARRY BOTT:** I mean, that sounds good. Yeah. It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's the case that BSL is, it's really like the cl like I said, I think I used the term the cleanest, it's the cleanest way to license software. There's, there, there are licenses that are similar. They're, but they're, you know, they have, you know, slightly different, more onerous respo, you know, um, aspects to them.

[01:10:57] **HARRY BOTT:** Whereas BSL is, it's ideal for open, open. [01:11:00] There's no, no, it's, so it's a BSL license is, is, is, is the least intrusive license. So it's, it's, it's, um, it's ideal for open source, open source software. I can't, I'm starting to, yeah.
