[00:00:11], Alexander Stepanov, boost, history, personal, origins
"Well, I would say that I did, uh, I have very minor relation with Boost."

[00:00:44], Alexander Stepanov, boost, technical, meta-programming, philosophy
"Boost migrated away from dealing with algorithms and data structures, which was my concentration to what they call template meta programming, which I had to do."

[00:02:15], Alexander Stepanov, boost, community, personal
"But again, my relation is tangential boosters, collection of libraries, uh, C++."

[00:03:46], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, history, personal, leadership
"He is absolutely unique in one fundamental aspect. He started working on C++ in 1978 and he's still working on it."

[00:05:00], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, history, leadership, dedication
"I don't know anyone who, who could. Uh, he goes, gives amazing amount of talks all over the world explaining what is the fundamental principles of C++."

[00:06:08], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, personal, history, stl
"I owe him a great deal because he enabled my work to sort of materialize."

[00:07:00], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, philosophy, technical
"He stuck to one fundamental principle, keep the language close to the machine."

[00:07:30], Alexander Stepanov, technical, philosophy, cpp
"You could feel the bits with my toes."

[00:14:00], Alexander Stepanov, stl, history, origins, doug-mcilroy
"STL Actually originated long before I, uh, learned to program well."

[00:15:00], Alexander Stepanov, doug-mcilroy, history, origins, bell-labs
"That was a talk by Doug McIlroy, whom I would call a forgotten great computer scientist, one of the most fundamental contributors to what happened."

[00:15:30], Alexander Stepanov, bell-labs, history, unix
"He was the guy very much behind Bell Labs computer science. He managed a group and I think that neither Unix nor C nor C++ would have existed if it were not for him."

[00:17:00], Alexander Stepanov, stl, history, origins, philosophy
"There should be massive catalogs of algorithms and data structures, which provide different trade-offs, solve different problems, and they should be produced in industrial way."

[00:23:00], Alexander Stepanov, generic-programming, history, origins, personal
"And I realized that behind every algorithm there is a mathematical abstraction on widget is based."

[00:24:00], Alexander Stepanov, generic-programming, history, origins
"That's the origins of SDL genetic programming. 'cause while being delirious, I realized that certain class of algorithms very common, very common class of algorithms are affiliated."

[00:28:00], Alexander Stepanov, dave-musser, history, collaboration, generic-programming
"The first person who didn't understand and he became very important collaborator is Dave Masser."

[00:37:00], Alexander Stepanov, stl, history, standardization, andrew-koenig
"The person who responsible for that is Andrew Koenig, uh, who was one of earliest collaborators of Bjarne."

[00:37:30], Alexander Stepanov, stl, standardization, politics
"Andrew Koenig suggested to me, why don't you submit your staff as a proposal to Standard Library?"

[00:38:00], Alexander Stepanov, cpp, history, object-oriented, philosophy
"I'm the professed enemy of object orientedness."

[00:39:00], Alexander Stepanov, personal, philosophy, propaganda
"Part of it is because I am propaganda resistant. Growing up in Soviet Union helped since I figured out that if everybody says something, it doesn't make it true."

[00:40:00], Alexander Stepanov, personal, career, conflict
"I have been forced out of multiple jobs because of my stated position."

[00:41:00], Alexander Stepanov, hp, object-oriented, conflict
"I remember when I did a still, I worked for HP Labs, and they hired me and then they discovered that I'm not objecting hundred."

[00:46:30], Alexander Stepanov, stl, history, meng-lee
"The person who actually helped me start is Mang Lee, there was a woman with whom I worked."

[00:47:00], Alexander Stepanov, meng-lee, stl, history, personal
"She literally forced me to start. I mean, she fired a FrameMaker and she put me in front of the computer and she fed me, brought me papaya to it."

[00:50:00], Alexander Stepanov, andrew-koenig, cpp, technical
"Andrew is a remarkable guy. He's one of the sharpest people I ever met. He understood what I was trying to do much faster than anybody else in C++ community."

[00:54:30], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, stl, understanding
"By that time I was there, he didn't under, I hate to say it, but I will say it, he didn't understand what I was talking about."

[00:55:00], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, stl, standardization, politics
"After he understood to a degree, he became a hundred percent supportive and spent literally all his time pushing STL and helping."

[00:55:30], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, stl, standardization, politics
"He pushed the steel into the standard. It was his doing. It wasn't my doing for sure."

[00:56:00], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, wg21, politics
"He could manipulate the standard committee. I'm, look, this is his life, he C++ and Bjarne."

[00:57:30], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, personal, dedication
"He would go, he will get invited to some community college to give a talk. He goes."

[00:58:00], Alexander Stepanov, wg21, politics, concepts, personal
"You have to understand that after 1995, well after the passage of STL into the standard, I did not attend a single meeting."

[00:58:30], Alexander Stepanov, concepts, standardization, bjarne-stroustrup
"I'm not boasting. So eventually, Bjarne put it in the standard. I never read the proposal."

[01:01:00], Alexander Stepanov, personal, friends, sean-parent, andrew-lumsdaine
"I know many of them are my good friends. I dunno whether you met Sean Parent. He's a very close friend of mine."

[01:05:00], Alexander Stepanov, andrew-lumsdaine, academia, indiana, students
"Andrew had a bunch of very talented guys working, I mean his students."

[01:06:30], Alexander Stepanov, doug-gregor, andrew-lumsdaine, academia
"Doug Gregor is one of his students, by the way."

[01:08:00], Alexander Stepanov, generic-programming, academia, career
"If people want to succeed, they have to do what is fashionable and genetic programming is not fashionable."

[01:08:30], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, academia, turing-award
"One of the, from my point of view, a scandalous thing is they never gave Bjarne tour award."

[01:09:00], Alexander Stepanov, bjarne-stroustrup, academia, recognition
"The academic community dislikes him intensely because he's successful."

[01:10:00], Alexander Stepanov, personal, legacy, mentorship
"I was not able to create a school, if you see what I'm saying."

[01:11:00], Alexander Stepanov, wg21, politics, personal
"I did not attend a single meeting. You know, I stayed totally out of all this politics. It's highly, I mean, the standard committees one of the most unpleasant things."

[01:11:30], Alexander Stepanov, wg21, politics, travel
"People who join the committee people who like travel, because you go to Europe once a year, you go to exotic occasions in the state once a year."

[01:12:00], Alexander Stepanov, wg21, politics, competence
"Well there are some people who know what they're talking about. Again, very clearly. Andrew Koenig, when he was, he doesn't go there anymore, but when he was there, he did know what he was talking about."

[01:13:30], Alexander Stepanov, herb-sutter, wg21, criticism
"Herb Sutter, okay, let me, since you brought him up, uh, long time ago, he published them, it's not a paper, but some kind of a magazine article where he said in SDL, you should always use deck."

[01:14:00], Alexander Stepanov, herb-sutter, microsoft, criticism
"I would not recommend follow any of his example. I don't know if he ever wrote code, not snippets for magazine articles, but actual some working code."

[01:14:30], Alexander Stepanov, microsoft, industry
"Microsoft is not a place for intelligent people in general, in my opinion."

[01:17:00], Alexander Stepanov, concepts, bjarne-stroustrup, indiana, conflict
"Bjarne was not prepared to make compromises."

[01:18:30], Alexander Stepanov, doug-gregor, concepts, implementation
"Doug Gregor did do an implementation. This is true of fact."

[01:19:00], Alexander Stepanov, concepts, bjarne-stroustrup, gdr, conflict
"Bjarne worked with a guy called Gabby Dos Reis. He hoped that Gabby would do the implementation for all I know Gabby doesn't know how to program."

[01:19:30], Alexander Stepanov, concepts, bjarne-stroustrup, indiana, politics
"Bjarne was determined not to let Indiana guys push the thing even if it was ready."

[01:20:00], Alexander Stepanov, philosophy, community, mathematics
"First lesson, we as a field, I mean, computer scientists have to become more mature."

[01:22:00], Alexander Stepanov, industry, open-source, corporate
"Every place wants to obfuscate code and make it ugly. Google, Adobe, Microsoft."

[01:23:00], Alexander Stepanov, stl, career, funding
"Right after I did SDL, I couldn't ever find a place which would fund a development of further work."

[01:23:30], Alexander Stepanov, open-source, philosophy, mathematics
"It has to be not just open source source, but really open completely. It's like mathematics. You cannot have proprietary mathematics."

[01:24:30], Alexander Stepanov, academia, industry, google, amazon, meta
"Academia right now is totally enthralled with Google, Amazon Meta."

[01:30:00], Alexander Stepanov, boost, future, open-source
"I do not predict the future."

[01:30:30], Alexander Stepanov, wg21, governance, future
"The mechanism of standard committee doesn't work. It's not a viable mechanism. There has to be done by competent people."

[01:31:00], Alexander Stepanov, governance, selection, academia
"There should be some selection. There should be like, you know, French Academy."
